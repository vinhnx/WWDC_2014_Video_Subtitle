These subtitle contents are provided by Apple, the original files are `Webvtt` format which is not a most frequently used format, so I fetch them from Apple website, then combine and translate them to `srt` format which is supported by most of video players.

You may find some files are blank, because Apple havn't provided the webvtt format file for them yet. Once I find they are ready, I will put them here.

Thanks to Edward, he told me some of the videos in the WWDC apps had got English subtitles yestoday and he is paying close attention to this thing all the time.
