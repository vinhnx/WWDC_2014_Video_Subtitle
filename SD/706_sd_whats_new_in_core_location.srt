1
00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:12.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello and good afternoon.

2
00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:18.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.256 A:middle
Welcome to our session on
What's New in Core Location.

4
00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.696 A:middle
My name is Stephen
Rhee and I work

5
00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:25.936 A:middle
on the Core Location framework.

6
00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:32.806 A:middle
So Core Location is available
on both iOS and OS X but today,

7
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.296 A:middle
the new features that
we're going to be talking

8
00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:36.536 A:middle
about today are specifically
for iOS.

9
00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:40.226 A:middle
Now some of you may be
new to Core Location

10
00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:41.966 A:middle
or even iOS, in general.

11
00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:44.336 A:middle
This will not be a review

12
00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:46.466 A:middle
of existing Core
Location functionality.

13
00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.656 A:middle
For that, we recommend
that you go

14
00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:53.146 A:middle
to our past WWDC
presentations online or check

15
00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:55.826 A:middle
out our great documentation
also available online.

16
00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:59.056 A:middle
Also, we'll be having a
lab session this Thursday,

17
00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:01.316 A:middle
so I recommend you all
come out and join us there

18
00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:04.436 A:middle
with any questions that
you have for us; however,

19
00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:07.336 A:middle
I think that today will
still be equally applicable

20
00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:10.146 A:middle
and interesting to those
of you who are new to iOS

21
00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:12.236 A:middle
and Core Location, to those

22
00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:14.276 A:middle
who are seasoned app
developers familiar

23
00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:16.246 A:middle
with both iOS and Core Location.

24
00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:20.186 A:middle
So what's new in Core
Location and iOS 8?

25
00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:27.826 A:middle
Today we're going to be location
authorization, visit monitoring,

26
00:01:28.686 --> 00:01:32.376 A:middle
and finally what's new is
indoor positioning; however,

27
00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:34.786 A:middle
we won't have time to talk
about that in this session

28
00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:37.176 A:middle
but directly following
this session here

29
00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:39.606 A:middle
in Marina [phonetic],
there'll be a dedicated session

30
00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:40.666 A:middle
to indoor positioning,

31
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:44.826 A:middle
so I recommend you all
stick around for that.

32
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:46.776 A:middle
So before we go on,
I'd like to start

33
00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:49.836 A:middle
with a brief history
of location on iOS.

34
00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:55.876 A:middle
Location was first introduced
in iOS 2 and then in iOS 3,

35
00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:57.686 A:middle
we added the ability
get heading updates.

36
00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.806 A:middle
In iOS 4, with the
introduction of multitasking,

37
00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.286 A:middle
came a whole slew
of new functionality

38
00:02:04.286 --> 00:02:08.076 A:middle
for location including
continuous background location,

39
00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:09.226 A:middle
which allows your app

40
00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:12.856 A:middle
to get continuous location
updates while in the background,

41
00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:16.076 A:middle
and region monitoring,
also known as geofencing,

42
00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:18.856 A:middle
which allows your app to
be launched and notified

43
00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:22.126 A:middle
when the user enters or
exits a predefined region,

44
00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:25.716 A:middle
to significant location changes,
which also allows your app

45
00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:27.066 A:middle
to be launched and notified

46
00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:29.916 A:middle
when the user's location
has changed significantly.

47
00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:34.776 A:middle
In iOS 5, we introduced
new APIs for geocoding,

48
00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:36.356 A:middle
both forward and reverse.

49
00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.636 A:middle
This allows you to take a
position that is a latitude

50
00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:42.176 A:middle
and longitude and
convert it to an address

51
00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:43.776 A:middle
or place mark and vice versa.

52
00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:48.436 A:middle
In iOS 6, we introduced
a power-efficient means

53
00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:49.716 A:middle
of getting location updates,

54
00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:52.216 A:middle
referred to as deferred
location updates,

55
00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:55.216 A:middle
in which locations will be
batched up and delivered

56
00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.256 A:middle
to your application

57
00:02:56.746 --> 00:03:00.006 A:middle
at a app-specified time
and/or distance interval.

58
00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:05.416 A:middle
And just last year in iOS 7, we
introduced iBeacon technology,

59
00:03:05.626 --> 00:03:06.886 A:middle
which has really
been taking off.

60
00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:10.776 A:middle
This allows you to determine
proximity via ranging

61
00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:15.146 A:middle
and region monitoring APIs,
which brings us to iOS 8,

62
00:03:15.146 --> 00:03:16.726 A:middle
which is what we're here
to talk about today.

63
00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:20.266 A:middle
As you can see, location
functionality has been growing

64
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.776 A:middle
in iOS, as have the
number of apps

65
00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.306 A:middle
that you guys have
been developing.

66
00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:30.146 A:middle
In fact, there are over 680,000
apps using location on iOS.

67
00:03:31.136 --> 00:03:34.066 A:middle
These are all kinds of apps
ranging from navigation

68
00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:37.936 A:middle
to help users find their
way home, to travel apps,

69
00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:40.956 A:middle
to help users find interesting
things to do around them,

70
00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:43.646 A:middle
to fitness apps to allow users

71
00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:47.426 A:middle
to track their exercise
sessions, and shopping apps

72
00:03:47.586 --> 00:03:50.146 A:middle
to help users find stores
and deals around them,

73
00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:54.476 A:middle
to social apps to allow users
to interact with their friends,

74
00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:58.376 A:middle
and even gaming apps to
allow interesting uses

75
00:03:58.486 --> 00:03:59.376 A:middle
of their location.

76
00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:05.226 A:middle
So what does location look
like on the device today?

77
00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:09.086 A:middle
There's a visual
indication of location

78
00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:11.876 A:middle
in use via the status
bar location arrow icon.

79
00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:15.786 A:middle
This can be solid, as we see
here in the example of maps,

80
00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:17.966 A:middle
which is displaying the
user's current location.

81
00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:20.986 A:middle
Generally, the solid arrow
indicates that location

82
00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.176 A:middle
or ranging, or significant
location changes is in use.

83
00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:31.236 A:middle
Here, even on the home screen,

84
00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:33.626 A:middle
if there's an application
using location

85
00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:36.036 A:middle
or significant location
changes in the background,

86
00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:37.966 A:middle
the solid arrow will remain lit.

87
00:04:38.876 --> 00:04:41.416 A:middle
In addition to the solid arrow,
we have the hollow arrow,

88
00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:44.306 A:middle
which indicates that
region monitoring is in use.

89
00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:47.206 A:middle
Here, we see a traditional
example of region monitoring,

90
00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:49.906 A:middle
the Reminders app, which
uses region monitoring

91
00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.786 A:middle
to deliver reminders
when the user has entered

92
00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.676 A:middle
or exited a pre-defined
location.

93
00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:58.306 A:middle
And again on the home screen,

94
00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:00.436 A:middle
if there are still apps
using region monitoring

95
00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:02.716 A:middle
in the background, the
hollow arrow will remain

96
00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:03.996 A:middle
in the status bar indicating

97
00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:05.716 A:middle
that region monitoring
is still in use.

98
00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:10.866 A:middle
Next, the user can control
and get a finer picture

99
00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:13.906 A:middle
of location usage via the
Location Services settings.

100
00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:18.216 A:middle
This is the Settings app under
Privacy, Location Services.

101
00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:23.136 A:middle
At the top we provide global
control of location services.

102
00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:27.336 A:middle
And down below, we provide
individual per app control

103
00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:28.266 A:middle
of location.

104
00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:32.366 A:middle
In addition, per app,
we provide an indication

105
00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.316 A:middle
of location usage by that app.

106
00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:37.796 A:middle
This can be indicated by a
solid purple arrow indicating

107
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.526 A:middle
that location has
recently been used,

108
00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:44.056 A:middle
to a solid gray arrow indicating
that location has been used

109
00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:49.086 A:middle
within the last 24 hours, or a
hollow purple arrow indicating

110
00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:51.826 A:middle
that region monitoring
is in use by the app.

111
00:05:53.656 --> 00:05:55.846 A:middle
So what does authorization
look like today?

112
00:05:56.726 --> 00:05:58.646 A:middle
Authorization is
a single request

113
00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:01.666 A:middle
that is prompted
implicitly on first usage

114
00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:02.816 A:middle
of location by your app.

115
00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:06.596 A:middle
This is for all location
functionality including location

116
00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:09.266 A:middle
directly in the app,
location from the background,

117
00:06:09.876 --> 00:06:11.806 A:middle
location use via
region monitoring,

118
00:06:12.176 --> 00:06:13.786 A:middle
and significant location
changes.

119
00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:18.656 A:middle
The text is also
customizable by the app.

120
00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:22.266 A:middle
Here we see a camera would like
to use your current location

121
00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:24.776 A:middle
with a description of
why camera uses location.

122
00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:27.536 A:middle
When location was
first introduced,

123
00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:30.586 A:middle
the request for the user's
current location was pretty

124
00:06:30.586 --> 00:06:34.046 A:middle
clear; however, with the
advent of multitasking

125
00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:37.346 A:middle
and all the powerful location
functionality that we talked

126
00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:40.436 A:middle
about was introduced allowing
you to create very cool

127
00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:44.066 A:middle
and powerful apps, we felt that
the user could use more clarity

128
00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:46.826 A:middle
of when location is being
used and more importantly,

129
00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.826 A:middle
we felt that your apps
could benefit too.

130
00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:53.536 A:middle
We don't want the user to
disable location, overall,

131
00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:56.006 A:middle
either globally or for
your app, disabling some

132
00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:59.136 A:middle
of the cool functionality that
you've developed using location.

133
00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:02.486 A:middle
We want them to understand
exactly how location is being

134
00:07:02.486 --> 00:07:04.786 A:middle
used, so ultimately
they can make better,

135
00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:07.676 A:middle
more informed decisions and
we believe that this is better

136
00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:09.706 A:middle
for battery and better
for privacy.

137
00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:13.406 A:middle
So to that end, we're
changing the way

138
00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:17.726 A:middle
that location services
works in iOS 8.

139
00:07:17.986 --> 00:07:20.766 A:middle
We started by looking at
first at all the functionality

140
00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:23.826 A:middle
that location services
provides and categorized it

141
00:07:23.906 --> 00:07:27.396 A:middle
into continuous updates,
which includes location,

142
00:07:27.826 --> 00:07:29.936 A:middle
background location,
and ranging,

143
00:07:30.806 --> 00:07:33.326 A:middle
and also location
monitoring or events,

144
00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:36.926 A:middle
which may launch the application
to deliver callbacks.

145
00:07:37.246 --> 00:07:38.736 A:middle
This includes region monitoring

146
00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:40.456 A:middle
and significant location
changes.

147
00:07:41.036 --> 00:07:44.696 A:middle
And we broke it down into
two authorization types,

148
00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.566 A:middle
the first being Always.

149
00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:50.786 A:middle
This is just like what location
authorization provided in iOS 7.

150
00:07:51.126 --> 00:07:53.556 A:middle
It provided both access
to continuous updates

151
00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:55.836 A:middle
and location monitoring even

152
00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:57.366 A:middle
when the app is in
the background.

153
00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.676 A:middle
But then we also introduced
WhenInUse, which is only

154
00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:04.716 A:middle
for continuous updates
and it's only

155
00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:07.496 A:middle
when the app is clearly
in use by the user.

156
00:08:07.496 --> 00:08:11.486 A:middle
So let's take a closer look
at Background Location.

157
00:08:11.936 --> 00:08:15.216 A:middle
Starting with continuous
background location,

158
00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:16.896 A:middle
which is specified statically

159
00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:20.346 A:middle
by the app either via the
Capabilities tab in Xcode

160
00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:22.466 A:middle
for background modes,
location updates

161
00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:26.286 A:middle
or via your app's information
property list via the UI

162
00:08:26.286 --> 00:08:29.186 A:middle
Background Mode key
specifying a value of location.

163
00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:33.296 A:middle
This, as before, must be started
in the foreground, otherwise

164
00:08:33.466 --> 00:08:35.936 A:middle
or if your app is using
significant location changes.

165
00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.986 A:middle
And this is available with
WhenInUse location authorization

166
00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:44.035 A:middle
because now in iOS 8,
we'll provide an indication

167
00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:46.966 A:middle
in the status bar that
your app is using location.

168
00:08:48.436 --> 00:08:50.776 A:middle
This is just like the
status bar for navigation,

169
00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:52.876 A:middle
when navigation is
running in the background.

170
00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:56.736 A:middle
Here, we'll indicate which
app is using location and,

171
00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.496 A:middle
if there are multiple,
we'll indicate the number

172
00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.926 A:middle
of apps using location, and the
user can tap on the status bar

173
00:09:01.926 --> 00:09:04.876 A:middle
to quickly return to the most
recent app using location

174
00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:07.196 A:middle
in the background.

175
00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:10.036 A:middle
One note is that if the
application is authorized

176
00:09:10.036 --> 00:09:14.226 A:middle
for Always location access, the
status bar will not be presented

177
00:09:14.626 --> 00:09:17.186 A:middle
because the user has
granted access for that app

178
00:09:17.606 --> 00:09:21.496 A:middle
to use location at any time,
which is what is needed in order

179
00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:24.066 A:middle
to access location anytime
from the background.

180
00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:27.256 A:middle
For example, when your app
is running the background due

181
00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:30.966 A:middle
to Background App Refresh or
due to region monitoring or due

182
00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:32.516 A:middle
to significant location changes,

183
00:09:33.016 --> 00:09:35.586 A:middle
this requires explicitly
Always authorization.

184
00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:38.996 A:middle
So on the topic of multitasking,

185
00:09:39.286 --> 00:09:41.506 A:middle
I'd like to clarify
location behavior.

186
00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:44.636 A:middle
When the user quits an
app from the App switcher,

187
00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:47.666 A:middle
this will immediately stop
Continuous Background Location;

188
00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:51.176 A:middle
however, this will not
stop location monitoring

189
00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:54.276 A:middle
such as significant location
changes or region monitoring.

190
00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:57.976 A:middle
This latter point is the
behavior as of iOS 7.1.

191
00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:03.786 A:middle
And now in iOS 8, disabling
Background App Refresh will no

192
00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:07.396 A:middle
longer disable any location
functionality because we believe

193
00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:10.186 A:middle
with the introduction of the new
location authorization types,

194
00:10:10.536 --> 00:10:13.666 A:middle
the user is now in complete
control of location usage.

195
00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:16.106 A:middle
So how does this all
look like to the user?

196
00:10:16.736 --> 00:10:22.196 A:middle
Apps must now explicitly request
authorization via new APIs.

197
00:10:23.006 --> 00:10:24.366 A:middle
We'll get into the exact details

198
00:10:24.366 --> 00:10:25.946 A:middle
of what this looks
like in just a bit.

199
00:10:26.696 --> 00:10:28.606 A:middle
Apps can request
for either WhenInUse

200
00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:30.686 A:middle
or for Always authorization.

201
00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:32.916 A:middle
Here, we see an example

202
00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:35.396 A:middle
of the authorization dialogue
presented to the user.

203
00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:37.886 A:middle
For compass, it says
Allow Compass

204
00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:41.126 A:middle
to Access Your Location
While You Use The App.

205
00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:43.126 A:middle
And below, we see
that customizable text

206
00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:45.716 A:middle
that your app can provide
indicating why it is

207
00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:47.126 A:middle
that your app uses location.

208
00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:50.696 A:middle
This text is now mandatory
and no longer optional.

209
00:10:52.016 --> 00:10:55.256 A:middle
This dialogue will be
presented only once to the user

210
00:10:55.966 --> 00:11:00.896 A:middle
for either request to location
access for WhenInUse or Always.

211
00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:04.276 A:middle
And as we said, that
text is customizable

212
00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:05.896 A:middle
and is mandatory to provide.

213
00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:08.146 A:middle
Quickly, we see an example

214
00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:09.956 A:middle
of the Always authorization
dialogue,

215
00:11:10.026 --> 00:11:13.716 A:middle
where it states Allow Weather
To Access Your Location Even

216
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.046 A:middle
When You Are Not Using The App.

217
00:11:15.566 --> 00:11:18.716 A:middle
Again, the text description
below describing why it is

218
00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:21.076 A:middle
that the app would like to
use the user's location.

219
00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:25.256 A:middle
So as we see, this
Always authorization,

220
00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:28.076 A:middle
which is what users got in
iOS 7, is pretty powerful.

221
00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:31.616 A:middle
Because of this, if Always
authorization was granted

222
00:11:31.616 --> 00:11:33.746 A:middle
by the user, the
user will be asked

223
00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:37.336 A:middle
to confirm a few
days later and only

224
00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.706 A:middle
if their Always authorization
was exercised,

225
00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:43.436 A:middle
that is the app did use location
in the background perhaps due

226
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.956 A:middle
to region monitoring or
significant location changes.

227
00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:49.216 A:middle
Here we see an example of
what that dialogue looks like,

228
00:11:49.596 --> 00:11:51.906 A:middle
where it says Weather Has
Been Using Your Location

229
00:11:51.906 --> 00:11:52.656 A:middle
In The Background.

230
00:11:52.656 --> 00:11:54.956 A:middle
Do You Want To Continue
Allowing This?

231
00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:58.326 A:middle
And again, we see that
the text is customizable.

232
00:11:58.326 --> 00:12:01.616 A:middle
It's the same usage description
provided in the original request

233
00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:02.966 A:middle
for location authorization.

234
00:12:03.516 --> 00:12:06.256 A:middle
So now let's take a look

235
00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:08.196 A:middle
at the new Location
Services settings pane.

236
00:12:08.926 --> 00:12:13.176 A:middle
Apps can support WhenInUse
and/or Always authorization

237
00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:16.696 A:middle
types and this is specified
statically by the app.

238
00:12:17.126 --> 00:12:17.986 A:middle
Again, we'll see the details

239
00:12:17.986 --> 00:12:20.866 A:middle
of exactly how you can
do this in just a bit.

240
00:12:21.586 --> 00:12:23.826 A:middle
And now in the Settings
pane for each app next

241
00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.466 A:middle
to the Location Usage
indication,

242
00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:28.196 A:middle
it will have the text
describing exactly what

243
00:12:28.196 --> 00:12:29.636 A:middle
that app is authorized for.

244
00:12:30.896 --> 00:12:33.056 A:middle
In addition, the user
can tap on the app

245
00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:36.546 A:middle
to see what authorization and
status types are supported

246
00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:39.586 A:middle
by that app with a text
description below indicating,

247
00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:41.496 A:middle
describing that current
selection.

248
00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:45.146 A:middle
Here we see an example
for WhenInUse app.

249
00:12:46.106 --> 00:12:49.456 A:middle
And quickly, another example
for an app that supports Always.

250
00:12:50.386 --> 00:12:55.246 A:middle
Note that in this pane, we don't
show the app description of why

251
00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:57.866 A:middle
that app would like
to use the location

252
00:12:58.376 --> 00:13:01.476 A:middle
in the current [inaudible];
however, you, as developers,

253
00:13:01.476 --> 00:13:03.736 A:middle
should prepare for
this because we believe

254
00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:06.156 A:middle
that this may present
another great opportunity

255
00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:09.426 A:middle
to inform the user why it is
that your app uses location.

256
00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:17.046 A:middle
Now also new in iOS 8, when the
user goes to the Settings apps

257
00:13:17.376 --> 00:13:18.696 A:middle
for your apps specifically,

258
00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:21.046 A:middle
a link to Privacy
will be included,

259
00:13:21.046 --> 00:13:22.426 A:middle
which also includes a link

260
00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:24.656 A:middle
to Location Services,
if applicable.

261
00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:27.256 A:middle
Here we see an example,
Fitness app.

262
00:13:27.756 --> 00:13:29.856 A:middle
The app Settings pane,
we see the Privacy.

263
00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:31.916 A:middle
The user can tap on that and get

264
00:13:31.916 --> 00:13:34.396 A:middle
to the Location Services
pane specifically

265
00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:36.106 A:middle
for its app right there

266
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:39.046 A:middle
and change the authorization
status immediately.

267
00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:41.926 A:middle
Now this is going to be
even more powerful for you

268
00:13:41.926 --> 00:13:46.436 A:middle
as app developers because now in
iOS 8, your app has the ability

269
00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:48.376 A:middle
to programmatically
jump directly

270
00:13:48.376 --> 00:13:49.606 A:middle
to your app Settings pane.

271
00:13:50.376 --> 00:13:52.796 A:middle
This is done with the
existing openURL method

272
00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:56.846 A:middle
on UIApplication providing
the new constant in iOS 8,

273
00:13:57.096 --> 00:14:00.136 A:middle
UIApplicationOpenSettingsURL
String.

274
00:14:01.176 --> 00:14:04.486 A:middle
We'll see exactly how useful
this can be later in an example.

275
00:14:05.526 --> 00:14:07.326 A:middle
So you all are probably
wondering, that's looks great

276
00:14:07.326 --> 00:14:10.816 A:middle
and well, so what is it that
I as a developer have to do?

277
00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.456 A:middle
Well, starting with the
actual interface changes,

278
00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:16.156 A:middle
there are only three changes
that you need to be aware of,

279
00:14:17.476 --> 00:14:20.146 A:middle
the relevant Info.plist
keys that we talked about,

280
00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:22.666 A:middle
the authorization
status enum values,

281
00:14:23.176 --> 00:14:26.036 A:middle
and finally the new
authorization request APIs.

282
00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:28.876 A:middle
So let's dive right
in, first starting

283
00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:30.216 A:middle
with the Info.plist keys.

284
00:14:31.446 --> 00:14:34.446 A:middle
Previously we had the
NSLocationUsageDescription,

285
00:14:34.766 --> 00:14:37.286 A:middle
which was optional
and allowed you

286
00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:39.746 A:middle
to customize the text
displayed to the user why it is

287
00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:41.126 A:middle
that your app uses location.

288
00:14:41.806 --> 00:14:44.826 A:middle
This is now deprecated and
replaced by two new keys,

289
00:14:45.306 --> 00:14:47.526 A:middle
NSLocationAlways
UsageDescription

290
00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:50.516 A:middle
and NSLocationWhenInUse-
UsageDescription.

291
00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.476 A:middle
Note again that's
specifying one or both

292
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.976 A:middle
of these is now mandatory,

293
00:14:55.266 --> 00:14:57.446 A:middle
depending on which
authorization type it is

294
00:14:57.526 --> 00:14:59.156 A:middle
that your application supports.

295
00:15:00.116 --> 00:15:02.136 A:middle
The value is the
string describing

296
00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:05.726 A:middle
to the user exactly why it is
that your app uses location.

297
00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:07.886 A:middle
We believe that this
is really going

298
00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:11.476 A:middle
to help users understand how it
is that your app uses location.

299
00:15:13.816 --> 00:15:17.186 A:middle
Moving on to the
CLAuthorizationStatus enum.

300
00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:19.596 A:middle
Previously there were
a number of values,

301
00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:21.996 A:middle
one of which was
kCLAuthorization

302
00:15:21.996 --> 00:15:23.066 A:middle
StatusAuthorized.

303
00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:27.756 A:middle
Now, this is deprecated and
replaced by two new values,

304
00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:31.336 A:middle
AuthorizedAlways and
AuthorizedWhenInUse,

305
00:15:31.926 --> 00:15:35.176 A:middle
depending on which authorization
was requested by your app

306
00:15:35.246 --> 00:15:37.816 A:middle
and which authorization
was granted by the user.

307
00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:42.326 A:middle
Accessing authorization status
for your app has not changed.

308
00:15:42.696 --> 00:15:45.696 A:middle
This can be done either
via the class method

309
00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:48.546 A:middle
on CLLocationManager
AuthorizationStatus

310
00:15:49.146 --> 00:15:52.566 A:middle
or via the delegate callback
via ChangeAuthorizationStatus

311
00:15:53.116 --> 00:15:55.906 A:middle
on the CLManager
delegate; however,

312
00:15:55.906 --> 00:16:00.026 A:middle
requesting authorization
has changed, which brings us

313
00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:03.826 A:middle
to the third interface change,
Request Authorization APIs.

314
00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:08.186 A:middle
Requesting authorization
is now explicit either

315
00:16:08.186 --> 00:16:11.086 A:middle
for Always or for WhenInUse.

316
00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:15.906 A:middle
Your app can make calls to
these requests APIs repeatedly;

317
00:16:16.196 --> 00:16:17.786 A:middle
however, it will only prompt

318
00:16:17.786 --> 00:16:20.856 A:middle
to the user the first
time and not per type.

319
00:16:21.406 --> 00:16:23.516 A:middle
So if you support both
authorization types,

320
00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:25.736 A:middle
you'll need to carefully
consider which you want

321
00:16:25.736 --> 00:16:26.766 A:middle
to request in your app.

322
00:16:27.556 --> 00:16:29.796 A:middle
We'll go further on this in
an example in just a bit.

323
00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:33.816 A:middle
So putting it all together,
there are three simple steps

324
00:16:34.106 --> 00:16:36.846 A:middle
to adopting the new
authorization in iOS 8.

325
00:16:37.826 --> 00:16:40.596 A:middle
First, you want to decide
which authorization it is

326
00:16:40.596 --> 00:16:44.016 A:middle
that your app supports by asking
yourself these two questions.

327
00:16:45.436 --> 00:16:49.346 A:middle
What location functionality
does your app use and is

328
00:16:49.346 --> 00:16:50.816 A:middle
that a mandatory functionality

329
00:16:50.816 --> 00:16:53.616 A:middle
or a nice-to-have
functionality for your app.

330
00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:55.516 A:middle
Second, you want to explain it

331
00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:58.326 A:middle
to your user exactly how
your app uses location.

332
00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:01.756 A:middle
And third, you want
to make the right call

333
00:17:01.756 --> 00:17:06.955 A:middle
to request authorization and
you want to do it when needed.

334
00:17:07.806 --> 00:17:11.455 A:middle
For example, when your app first
launches, don't make the request

335
00:17:11.576 --> 00:17:15.836 A:middle
to access location because the
user won't understand why it is

336
00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:18.276 A:middle
that your app is requesting
location authorization

337
00:17:18.526 --> 00:17:20.896 A:middle
and they may be inclined
to just deny that.

338
00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:24.465 A:middle
Instead, do it in response
to explicit user action

339
00:17:24.886 --> 00:17:27.086 A:middle
so that they have
context and in addition

340
00:17:27.086 --> 00:17:28.496 A:middle
to the usage description string

341
00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:30.876 A:middle
that you provide why
your app uses location,

342
00:17:30.876 --> 00:17:33.626 A:middle
the user can then make an
informed choice of whether

343
00:17:33.626 --> 00:17:36.006 A:middle
to allow or disallow
location access to the app.

344
00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:38.216 A:middle
Let's go through some examples.

345
00:17:39.216 --> 00:17:42.116 A:middle
First, let's say you've
developed this great fitness app

346
00:17:42.506 --> 00:17:43.836 A:middle
that tracks the user's runs.

347
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:47.246 A:middle
You want to start by first
determining how it is

348
00:17:47.246 --> 00:17:48.426 A:middle
that location is used.

349
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.316 A:middle
Obviously, this app is
going to use location.

350
00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:55.056 A:middle
In addition, it's going to use
background location in order

351
00:17:55.056 --> 00:17:57.556 A:middle
that the user may home-out
of your app and switch

352
00:17:57.556 --> 00:17:59.976 A:middle
to the music app and play
their favorite tunes.

353
00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:07.906 A:middle
So background location
can be enabled via Xcode

354
00:18:07.936 --> 00:18:12.306 A:middle
in the Capabilities tab, making
sure that background modes is on

355
00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:15.096 A:middle
and that location
updates is selected.

356
00:18:15.706 --> 00:18:18.826 A:middle
Alternatively, you can edit
your information property list

357
00:18:18.826 --> 00:18:21.946 A:middle
for you app specifying
the UIBackgroundModes key

358
00:18:22.116 --> 00:18:23.426 A:middle
with the value of location.

359
00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:28.436 A:middle
Second step is to add
the appropriate key

360
00:18:28.436 --> 00:18:30.106 A:middle
to your app's information
property list.

361
00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:34.016 A:middle
Here in Xcode, we'll go to the
Information Property List Editor

362
00:18:34.776 --> 00:18:36.096 A:middle
and add a new key

363
00:18:36.096 --> 00:18:39.746 A:middle
for NSLocationWhenInUseUsage
Description providing the

364
00:18:39.746 --> 00:18:40.786 A:middle
description to the user

365
00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:43.716 A:middle
that your location is
used to track your run.

366
00:18:44.616 --> 00:18:49.706 A:middle
And third, the final step is to
make the appropriate API call

367
00:18:49.706 --> 00:18:52.886 A:middle
to request authorization
and do it when needed.

368
00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:55.596 A:middle
So here, after creating
your locationManager setting

369
00:18:55.596 --> 00:18:57.646 A:middle
to delegate and right
before making the call

370
00:18:57.646 --> 00:19:01.206 A:middle
to startUpdatingLocation, all
you need to do is make the call

371
00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.226 A:middle
to
requestWhenInUseAuthorization.

372
00:19:03.756 --> 00:19:04.626 A:middle
Pretty simple, right?

373
00:19:05.826 --> 00:19:07.316 A:middle
Let's move on to
another example.

374
00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.716 A:middle
Let's say you've created this
great WelcomeHome app that's

375
00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:12.466 A:middle
going to automatically
turn on the lights

376
00:19:12.566 --> 00:19:14.616 A:middle
and maybe even unlock
the front door

377
00:19:14.616 --> 00:19:16.126 A:middle
when the user has
arrived at home.

378
00:19:16.816 --> 00:19:18.156 A:middle
Again, you'll want to start

379
00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:21.046 A:middle
by determining how location
is being used by your app.

380
00:19:21.886 --> 00:19:24.646 A:middle
In this case, it's using
region monitoring to detect

381
00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:26.476 A:middle
when the user has
arrived at home.

382
00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:30.206 A:middle
Next, you'll need to add the
appropriate usage description

383
00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:32.826 A:middle
key to your app's
information property list.

384
00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:36.216 A:middle
Again, you'll go to the
information property list editor

385
00:19:36.286 --> 00:19:38.376 A:middle
in Xcode and this time add a key

386
00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:42.186 A:middle
for NSLocationAlways
UsageDescription providing a

387
00:19:42.186 --> 00:19:44.226 A:middle
description to the user
here in this example,

388
00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
here location is used to
determine when you arrive home.

389
00:19:48.956 --> 00:19:51.736 A:middle
And finally, you'll want to
make the appropriate call

390
00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:54.976 A:middle
to request authorization
and again, do it as needed.

391
00:19:55.216 --> 00:19:58.656 A:middle
In this case, right before
the call to start monitoring

392
00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.686 A:middle
for region, you'll
want to add the call

393
00:20:00.686 --> 00:20:02.846 A:middle
to requestAlwaysAuthorization.

394
00:20:03.616 --> 00:20:05.086 A:middle
Again, pretty straightforward.

395
00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:08.796 A:middle
How about if your app
actually supports both

396
00:20:08.796 --> 00:20:09.976 A:middle
authorization types.

397
00:20:10.856 --> 00:20:13.956 A:middle
Let's say you've developed this
great app for an amusement park.

398
00:20:14.416 --> 00:20:17.636 A:middle
In the general use case, it'll
show the app's current location

399
00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:18.816 A:middle
in the AmusementPark map

400
00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:21.636 A:middle
but let's say you've
developed this cool feature

401
00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:24.776 A:middle
that will additionally
deliver cool information

402
00:20:24.776 --> 00:20:26.796 A:middle
about nearby attractions
to the user.

403
00:20:27.206 --> 00:20:30.546 A:middle
And in this case, you'll want
to determine exactly how it is

404
00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:32.016 A:middle
that your app is using location.

405
00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:35.086 A:middle
Obviously for the general use
case displaying the user's

406
00:20:35.086 --> 00:20:37.116 A:middle
location on the map,
your using location,

407
00:20:37.616 --> 00:20:39.446 A:middle
but for that cool
feature that tells them

408
00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:41.676 A:middle
about cool attractions
nearby, you're going

409
00:20:41.676 --> 00:20:43.036 A:middle
to be using region monitoring.

410
00:20:44.806 --> 00:20:46.866 A:middle
So again, we follow
the same steps.

411
00:20:47.296 --> 00:20:49.616 A:middle
First, we're going to add the
appropriate usage description

412
00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:53.586 A:middle
keys to the app's information
property list again by going

413
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.556 A:middle
to the property list
editor in Xcode.

414
00:20:56.346 --> 00:20:58.056 A:middle
We'll first start
by adding a key

415
00:20:58.056 --> 00:21:01.596 A:middle
for NSLocationWhenInUse
UsageDescription specifying

416
00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:04.876 A:middle
that your current location
may be shown on the map.

417
00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:10.046 A:middle
In addition to that, because
your app also supports Always

418
00:21:10.046 --> 00:21:11.836 A:middle
authorization, you'll add a key

419
00:21:11.836 --> 00:21:14.436 A:middle
to NSLocationAlways
UsageDescription,

420
00:21:14.876 --> 00:21:17.166 A:middle
again providing a
description to why it is

421
00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:18.646 A:middle
that your app uses location.

422
00:21:18.976 --> 00:21:22.016 A:middle
Here, this app will use
your location information

423
00:21:22.236 --> 00:21:24.226 A:middle
to identify nearby attractions.

424
00:21:26.006 --> 00:21:28.686 A:middle
So in your app's
information property list,

425
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.666 A:middle
you'll actually have both of
these usage description keys

426
00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:34.646 A:middle
because your app supports both
of these authorization types.

427
00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:38.756 A:middle
And finally, you'll want to make
the corresponding authorization

428
00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:40.006 A:middle
request API calls.

429
00:21:40.436 --> 00:21:42.456 A:middle
Again, you'll want to
do this when needed.

430
00:21:42.846 --> 00:21:44.536 A:middle
For example, in the map view

431
00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.126 A:middle
that displays the
AmusementPark map,

432
00:21:46.876 --> 00:21:50.566 A:middle
you'll want to right before
startUpdatingLocation,

433
00:21:50.956 --> 00:21:54.616 A:middle
you'll make the call to
requestWhenInUseAuthorization.

434
00:21:55.736 --> 00:21:59.736 A:middle
And for that power user
use case, still in response

435
00:21:59.796 --> 00:22:04.406 A:middle
to user action, perhaps the
user has now enabled the feature

436
00:22:04.796 --> 00:22:07.926 A:middle
that enables the automatic
attraction info mode

437
00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:11.846 A:middle
that delivers information
about ride times

438
00:22:12.226 --> 00:22:15.076 A:middle
for the nearby attractions
or store sales

439
00:22:15.346 --> 00:22:18.786 A:middle
or restaurant specials, but
in this case, you may want

440
00:22:18.786 --> 00:22:21.376 A:middle
to check your app's
authorization status first

441
00:22:21.886 --> 00:22:24.286 A:middle
because if it's denied
or when in use,

442
00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:26.666 A:middle
you'll need to tell
the user that they need

443
00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:29.256 A:middle
to authorize your app
for Always authorization.

444
00:22:30.236 --> 00:22:33.706 A:middle
And in this case, you may want
to present an alert indicating

445
00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:36.876 A:middle
that and offer to take them
directly to the Settings app

446
00:22:37.406 --> 00:22:40.056 A:middle
for your app's settings
pane using

447
00:22:40.226 --> 00:22:42.506 A:middle
that mentioned openUrl method

448
00:22:42.776 --> 00:22:44.836 A:middle
with the new
UIApplicationOpenSettings

449
00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:45.556 A:middle
URLString.

450
00:22:46.016 --> 00:22:49.616 A:middle
And then finally, right
before you start to call

451
00:22:49.616 --> 00:22:50.866 A:middle
to start monitoring for region,

452
00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:53.906 A:middle
you'll make the call the
requestAlwaysAuthorization.

453
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:59.796 A:middle
So some additional
details, what if you want

454
00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:04.966 A:middle
to support both iOS 7
and iOS 8 with your app.

455
00:23:05.226 --> 00:23:07.046 A:middle
Well there are three things
that you want to consider,

456
00:23:07.466 --> 00:23:09.356 A:middle
the lineup with the three
interface changes we

457
00:23:09.356 --> 00:23:10.506 A:middle
discussed earlier.

458
00:23:11.046 --> 00:23:12.446 A:middle
First, you'll want to continue

459
00:23:12.446 --> 00:23:15.376 A:middle
to provide the deprecated
NSLocationUsageDescription

460
00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:17.406 A:middle
string if you were
doing so before.

461
00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:20.336 A:middle
In addition, to specify
one or both

462
00:23:20.336 --> 00:23:23.616 A:middle
of the new Always
usage description

463
00:23:23.616 --> 00:23:25.536 A:middle
or WhenInUse usage
description keys.

464
00:23:26.806 --> 00:23:30.226 A:middle
Next, you'll want to guard the
request authorization API call

465
00:23:30.226 --> 00:23:33.356 A:middle
with respondsToSelector so
that your app will still work

466
00:23:33.356 --> 00:23:34.276 A:middle
on iOS 7.

467
00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:37.156 A:middle
Here's a quick example of
exactly how to do that.

468
00:23:37.156 --> 00:23:41.756 A:middle
And third, you'll
want to continue

469
00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:45.926 A:middle
to use the deprecated
kCLAuthorizationStatusAuthorize

470
00:23:45.926 --> 00:23:48.766 A:middle
value in addition to
the new authorize Always

471
00:23:48.766 --> 00:23:50.576 A:middle
and authorize WhenInUse values.

472
00:23:52.796 --> 00:23:55.846 A:middle
So I bet you're wondering,
what about legacy app support,

473
00:23:56.216 --> 00:23:57.626 A:middle
what if you don't
update your app

474
00:23:58.036 --> 00:24:00.946 A:middle
but your user upgrades
his system to iOS 8,

475
00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:01.946 A:middle
what's going to happen?

476
00:24:02.556 --> 00:24:04.616 A:middle
Well, your app will
still continue to work

477
00:24:05.436 --> 00:24:08.656 A:middle
but it will use Always
authorization.

478
00:24:09.396 --> 00:24:10.896 A:middle
So you don't want
to rely on this

479
00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:14.276 A:middle
because when the user uses
your app and uses location

480
00:24:14.276 --> 00:24:17.196 A:middle
for the first time, it's going
to pop that dialogue asking

481
00:24:17.196 --> 00:24:19.866 A:middle
for location access Always even

482
00:24:19.866 --> 00:24:23.156 A:middle
if your app only uses WhenInUse
location functionality,

483
00:24:23.436 --> 00:24:27.326 A:middle
such as location in the app or
background location or ranging.

484
00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:30.376 A:middle
So your user may at
that point decide

485
00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:32.016 A:middle
to disallow location usage.

486
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:33.956 A:middle
So you don't want
this to happen.

487
00:24:34.016 --> 00:24:35.436 A:middle
You want to update your app now

488
00:24:35.846 --> 00:24:39.806 A:middle
and you saw exactly how
simple it is to do so.

489
00:24:39.806 --> 00:24:41.096 A:middle
So what about updating your app?

490
00:24:41.706 --> 00:24:44.496 A:middle
You can change the supported
authorization types anytime you

491
00:24:44.496 --> 00:24:49.616 A:middle
update your app and so when
your user updates the version

492
00:24:49.616 --> 00:24:53.196 A:middle
of the app, the version of your
app on his phone or device,

493
00:24:53.856 --> 00:24:56.916 A:middle
it will preserve the
user's authorization

494
00:24:57.186 --> 00:24:58.096 A:middle
if still supported.

495
00:24:58.926 --> 00:25:03.296 A:middle
Otherwise, it will go
from Always to WhenInUse.

496
00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:06.176 A:middle
For example, if your app
no longer supports Always

497
00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:10.126 A:middle
authorization but now
supports WhenInUse and it'll go

498
00:25:10.126 --> 00:25:11.936 A:middle
from WhenInUse to prompt again.

499
00:25:12.286 --> 00:25:14.716 A:middle
For example, again if your app
no longer supports WhenInUse

500
00:25:14.716 --> 00:25:17.616 A:middle
in this case and may now
support Always authorization.

501
00:25:18.256 --> 00:25:21.376 A:middle
But again, don't wait to adopt

502
00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:24.066 A:middle
because if the user denies
location access to your app,

503
00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:27.996 A:middle
it will stay denied even if you
subsequently change your app

504
00:25:28.246 --> 00:25:31.466 A:middle
to support the WhenInUse
authorization type.

505
00:25:33.976 --> 00:25:36.936 A:middle
So what about other frameworks
where location is used?

506
00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:40.706 A:middle
Let's go back to the
example WelcomeHome app.

507
00:25:41.286 --> 00:25:44.336 A:middle
Let's say that you don't want
your app to automatically turn

508
00:25:44.336 --> 00:25:47.296 A:middle
on the lights or even more
dangerously unlock the front

509
00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:48.306 A:middle
door automatically.

510
00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:51.226 A:middle
Instead, all you want
to do is notify the user

511
00:25:51.686 --> 00:25:53.426 A:middle
and let them decide to choose

512
00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:55.486 A:middle
to take action on
that notification.

513
00:25:56.386 --> 00:25:59.076 A:middle
In this case, your app actually
doesn't need to be launched,

514
00:25:59.496 --> 00:26:03.696 A:middle
just a notification needs to
be provided and now in iOS 8,

515
00:26:04.026 --> 00:26:05.756 A:middle
we've added region-based
triggering

516
00:26:05.816 --> 00:26:10.026 A:middle
to UILocalNotification
via the specification

517
00:26:10.026 --> 00:26:12.916 A:middle
of the CLRegion property
on the UILocalNotification.

518
00:26:13.586 --> 00:26:16.936 A:middle
In this case, your app doesn't
need Always authorization

519
00:26:16.936 --> 00:26:18.496 A:middle
because your app
will not be launched

520
00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:19.906 A:middle
in response to region
monitoring.

521
00:26:20.256 --> 00:26:22.466 A:middle
Instead, the system will
provide the notification

522
00:26:22.466 --> 00:26:26.376 A:middle
that you specified to be
provided to the user on behalf

523
00:26:26.806 --> 00:26:29.896 A:middle
and only when the user decides
to respond to that notification

524
00:26:30.336 --> 00:26:33.756 A:middle
and launch your app will
your app actually be in use.

525
00:26:34.626 --> 00:26:37.996 A:middle
So usage of this API
requires either authorization,

526
00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:41.886 A:middle
Always or WhenInUse but only
needs your app to be supported

527
00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:43.366 A:middle
for WhenInUse authorization.

528
00:26:43.916 --> 00:26:46.336 A:middle
And the steps to use
this API are the same

529
00:26:46.336 --> 00:26:48.036 A:middle
as any other location
functionality.

530
00:26:48.526 --> 00:26:52.016 A:middle
You'll want to specify the
desired usage description key

531
00:26:52.016 --> 00:26:55.286 A:middle
in your Info.plist with the text
string describing how it is your

532
00:26:55.286 --> 00:26:58.966 A:middle
app uses location and call the
corresponding authorization

533
00:26:58.966 --> 00:27:03.086 A:middle
request API, as needed.

534
00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:07.096 A:middle
What if you use MKMapView on
your app to display a map view

535
00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:11.606 A:middle
with the user's current location
via the showsUserLocation

536
00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:14.766 A:middle
property on the MKMapView class.

537
00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:19.946 A:middle
Again, this requires either
authorization for your app

538
00:27:19.946 --> 00:27:23.236 A:middle
but only needs your
app to be authorized

539
00:27:23.236 --> 00:27:24.846 A:middle
for WhenInUse authorization.

540
00:27:25.726 --> 00:27:28.886 A:middle
And the same steps as
before, you need to specify

541
00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:31.586 A:middle
which authorization
your app supports

542
00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:34.146 A:middle
in your app's information
property list

543
00:27:34.826 --> 00:27:36.666 A:middle
and make the corresponding
API call

544
00:27:36.666 --> 00:27:39.096 A:middle
to request authorization
when needed.

545
00:27:40.506 --> 00:27:42.696 A:middle
One last one I'd like to
talk about, Web views.

546
00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:47.516 A:middle
To allow web content that
uses HTML5 geolocation

547
00:27:47.896 --> 00:27:49.856 A:middle
to access the user's
current location,

548
00:27:51.116 --> 00:27:53.596 A:middle
this one also requires
either authorization

549
00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:56.926 A:middle
but again only needs the
WhenInUse authorization.

550
00:27:58.256 --> 00:28:01.376 A:middle
Again, you'll specify in your
app's information property list

551
00:28:01.866 --> 00:28:03.406 A:middle
the usage description
keys relevant

552
00:28:03.726 --> 00:28:05.986 A:middle
with a text description why
it is that your app would

553
00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:09.846 A:middle
like to use the user's
location; however, in this case,

554
00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:12.736 A:middle
the authorization request
will be made automatically

555
00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:16.006 A:middle
for WhenInUse on your behalf
because you may not know

556
00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:19.976 A:middle
when the user navigates to a
web page that uses geolocation;

557
00:28:20.836 --> 00:28:24.646 A:middle
however, if your app uses
Always authorization,

558
00:28:25.226 --> 00:28:27.416 A:middle
you'll want to make that
authorization request

559
00:28:27.566 --> 00:28:29.286 A:middle
in advance, if so desired.

560
00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:35.916 A:middle
So a quick recap, get ready

561
00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:38.866 A:middle
for the location authorization
changes that are coming in iOS 8

562
00:28:39.236 --> 00:28:41.386 A:middle
by following these
three simple steps.

563
00:28:41.796 --> 00:28:45.006 A:middle
First, think about how
your app uses location.

564
00:28:45.616 --> 00:28:47.896 A:middle
Second, explain it your users.

565
00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:53.486 A:middle
And third and finally, make the
call to request authorization.

566
00:28:54.506 --> 00:28:55.086 A:middle
Don't wait.

567
00:28:55.466 --> 00:28:56.186 A:middle
Do it today.

568
00:28:56.186 --> 00:28:59.526 A:middle
And then if you have any
questions, on Thursday,

569
00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:02.276 A:middle
you can come to us in our lab
session here this week at WWDC

570
00:29:02.276 --> 00:29:05.096 A:middle
with any issues or
questions that you encounter.

571
00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:09.146 A:middle
Next, I'd like to introduce
Brad, who's here to talk

572
00:29:09.146 --> 00:29:10.816 A:middle
about Visit Monitoring.

573
00:29:11.346 --> 00:29:11.996 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks Stephen.

574
00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:13.656 A:middle
I'm Brad Jensen.

575
00:29:13.656 --> 00:29:16.356 A:middle
I'm a Core Location engineer
and I'm excited to introduce

576
00:29:16.356 --> 00:29:17.936 A:middle
to you Visit Monitoring.

577
00:29:18.596 --> 00:29:21.506 A:middle
But first, I want to
write an app with you.

578
00:29:22.096 --> 00:29:24.926 A:middle
See, Apple engineers aren't
allowed to publish apps

579
00:29:24.926 --> 00:29:27.196 A:middle
and I really want a journaling
app, so you're going to have

580
00:29:27.196 --> 00:29:28.606 A:middle
to help me out with this.

581
00:29:28.606 --> 00:29:30.906 A:middle
Journaling apps are
really interesting to me

582
00:29:30.906 --> 00:29:34.416 A:middle
but more importantly,
they're a great example

583
00:29:34.416 --> 00:29:35.436 A:middle
of Visit Monitoring.

584
00:29:35.776 --> 00:29:38.506 A:middle
It's a great type of
app that makes use

585
00:29:38.506 --> 00:29:39.506 A:middle
of this new technology.

586
00:29:39.936 --> 00:29:42.316 A:middle
So, what constitutes
a journaling app?

587
00:29:42.986 --> 00:29:46.856 A:middle
Well, first and foremost, it's
got to provide the user a list

588
00:29:46.856 --> 00:29:49.136 A:middle
of locations of where
they've been during their day.

589
00:29:50.336 --> 00:29:53.486 A:middle
But more importantly, that
list of locations needs

590
00:29:53.486 --> 00:29:54.606 A:middle
to be relevant to them.

591
00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:57.576 A:middle
If we list every time they
stopped at a interaction

592
00:29:57.576 --> 00:29:59.226 A:middle
or a stop sign, then
they're not going to find

593
00:29:59.226 --> 00:29:59.976 A:middle
that list especially useful.

594
00:30:00.186 --> 00:30:03.946 A:middle
Finally, we want to make sure

595
00:30:03.986 --> 00:30:06.806 A:middle
that our journaling
app can last all day.

596
00:30:06.806 --> 00:30:09.126 A:middle
If it's going to drain
the user's battery in two

597
00:30:09.126 --> 00:30:11.406 A:middle
to three hours, it's not
going to be very useful.

598
00:30:12.856 --> 00:30:15.296 A:middle
So, let's take a look at the
different Core Location APIs

599
00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:17.826 A:middle
that exist today and
we'll see why none

600
00:30:17.826 --> 00:30:19.656 A:middle
of them really work well
for journaling apps.

601
00:30:20.206 --> 00:30:21.696 A:middle
If you're working
on a check-in app,

602
00:30:21.836 --> 00:30:23.486 A:middle
you might find this
awfully familiar.

603
00:30:25.436 --> 00:30:27.806 A:middle
First up is the standard
location service.

604
00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:29.536 A:middle
This is where we
provide your app

605
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:32.316 A:middle
with periodic location updates
as they become available.

606
00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:35.906 A:middle
Naturally, if we're going to be
providing updates to your app,

607
00:30:35.906 --> 00:30:39.976 A:middle
this requires the phone to be
awake and even more importantly,

608
00:30:39.976 --> 00:30:41.956 A:middle
the radios have to stay awake.

609
00:30:42.256 --> 00:30:45.066 A:middle
We have to periodically
scan for WiFi networks,

610
00:30:45.606 --> 00:30:48.706 A:middle
for cell towers or GPS.

611
00:30:50.336 --> 00:30:53.766 A:middle
Now, all of this is fairly
expensive and that means

612
00:30:53.826 --> 00:30:58.166 A:middle
that the app is going to be
consuming a lot of power.

613
00:30:58.366 --> 00:31:00.006 A:middle
In addition, the app is going

614
00:31:00.006 --> 00:31:02.026 A:middle
to receive a lot
of irrelevant data.

615
00:31:02.706 --> 00:31:04.986 A:middle
You're going to have to take
the stream of locations and try

616
00:31:04.986 --> 00:31:07.716 A:middle
and make sense of it, try
and identify those locations

617
00:31:07.716 --> 00:31:09.526 A:middle
that are probably
significant to the user.

618
00:31:11.206 --> 00:31:14.236 A:middle
So this isn't really a good
fit for a journaling app,

619
00:31:14.526 --> 00:31:17.366 A:middle
but if we were instead
writing a navigation app,

620
00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:19.136 A:middle
this would make a lot of sense.

621
00:31:19.426 --> 00:31:22.416 A:middle
You need the most up-to-date
information available in order

622
00:31:22.416 --> 00:31:25.466 A:middle
to tell the user when
to make their next move.

623
00:31:26.296 --> 00:31:29.446 A:middle
Before we totally throw out
standard location service

624
00:31:29.506 --> 00:31:32.026 A:middle
for journaling apps,
there are a couple

625
00:31:32.026 --> 00:31:33.396 A:middle
of improvements we
might consider.

626
00:31:34.416 --> 00:31:36.946 A:middle
A while ago we introduced
the automatic pause feature.

627
00:31:37.456 --> 00:31:39.936 A:middle
This allows Core
Location to save power

628
00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:44.186 A:middle
by pausing location
updates once it's determined

629
00:31:44.186 --> 00:31:46.366 A:middle
that the device probably
isn't in motion anymore.

630
00:31:47.536 --> 00:31:49.996 A:middle
This is really exciting
because it means,

631
00:31:50.066 --> 00:31:51.326 A:middle
well, we get to save power.

632
00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:53.616 A:middle
The device gets to
keep journaling longer.

633
00:31:54.126 --> 00:31:56.926 A:middle
Unfortunately, once the
user starts moving again,

634
00:31:56.926 --> 00:31:59.276 A:middle
your app will have to resume
those location updates.

635
00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:05.776 A:middle
And so we won't actually help

636
00:32:05.776 --> 00:32:08.666 A:middle
or this won't actually save
standard location service

637
00:32:08.666 --> 00:32:10.076 A:middle
in terms of writing
journaling apps.

638
00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:13.286 A:middle
If we were writing that
navigation app, however,

639
00:32:13.286 --> 00:32:14.566 A:middle
this would be a huge win.

640
00:32:15.056 --> 00:32:17.016 A:middle
Once the user stops
at a gas station,

641
00:32:17.626 --> 00:32:19.886 A:middle
automatic pause will save
their phone's battery.

642
00:32:21.216 --> 00:32:24.156 A:middle
Another option we might consider
is deferred location updates.

643
00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:26.706 A:middle
This one is really
interesting as well.

644
00:32:27.116 --> 00:32:28.956 A:middle
It allows Core Location
to save power

645
00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:30.786 A:middle
by waking up your app list.

646
00:32:31.626 --> 00:32:33.046 A:middle
App wake-ups cost power

647
00:32:33.046 --> 00:32:36.496 A:middle
and so fewer app launches
means more power saved.

648
00:32:37.526 --> 00:32:40.866 A:middle
Unfortunately, generating
locations is still quite

649
00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:43.066 A:middle
expensive and so even
though we're saving power

650
00:32:43.066 --> 00:32:45.676 A:middle
by not launching your app
every time there's new data,

651
00:32:45.996 --> 00:32:48.166 A:middle
we're still generating
all those locations

652
00:32:48.526 --> 00:32:51.166 A:middle
and not especially great.

653
00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:56.016 A:middle
So, deferred location updates
aren't exactly what we want;

654
00:32:56.706 --> 00:32:59.996 A:middle
however, if we were
writing a fitness app,

655
00:33:00.616 --> 00:33:01.396 A:middle
they would be great.

656
00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:04.556 A:middle
If you're writing
a run tracker app,

657
00:33:04.556 --> 00:33:06.856 A:middle
you don't necessarily
need the latest location

658
00:33:06.856 --> 00:33:07.846 A:middle
in the moment that's available.

659
00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:10.816 A:middle
It might be okay to
receive it every mile

660
00:33:10.816 --> 00:33:12.916 A:middle
or every 15 minutes or so.

661
00:33:13.766 --> 00:33:16.316 A:middle
All right, what else
do we have for us?

662
00:33:16.856 --> 00:33:18.186 A:middle
Well, there's the standard

663
00:33:18.186 --> 00:33:20.056 A:middle
or the significant
location change API.

664
00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:23.326 A:middle
This one is a lot
more power efficient

665
00:33:23.326 --> 00:33:24.836 A:middle
than continuous location
updates,

666
00:33:25.316 --> 00:33:26.566 A:middle
but there's a cost to this.

667
00:33:27.196 --> 00:33:31.676 A:middle
Instead of getting all of the
data, you get very coarse tracks

668
00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:32.756 A:middle
of where the user went.

669
00:33:33.126 --> 00:33:36.136 A:middle
Specifically, you only get
location updates every few

670
00:33:36.136 --> 00:33:38.236 A:middle
hundred meters the device moves.

671
00:33:39.236 --> 00:33:41.386 A:middle
This is going to make it
incredibly difficult for us

672
00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:43.926 A:middle
to identify places that
the user stopped at since

673
00:33:43.926 --> 00:33:48.006 A:middle
when the user stops, we stop
giving updates to your app.

674
00:33:48.766 --> 00:33:51.556 A:middle
If we were writing a
different app, for example one

675
00:33:51.556 --> 00:33:54.966 A:middle
that showed the user the path
they took home maybe identifies

676
00:33:55.006 --> 00:33:56.776 A:middle
the freeways they drove on,

677
00:33:57.176 --> 00:33:59.596 A:middle
then significant location
changes would make a lot

678
00:33:59.596 --> 00:33:59.936 A:middle
of sense.

679
00:34:00.786 --> 00:34:03.046 A:middle
But we're working on a
journaling app today,

680
00:34:03.506 --> 00:34:04.606 A:middle
so we're going to
have to keep looking.

681
00:34:06.056 --> 00:34:08.146 A:middle
Our last option is
region monitoring.

682
00:34:08.706 --> 00:34:10.906 A:middle
Region monitoring is really cool

683
00:34:10.906 --> 00:34:13.056 A:middle
because it's highly
power efficient.

684
00:34:13.525 --> 00:34:16.436 A:middle
Region monitoring can continue
while the phone is asleep

685
00:34:17.275 --> 00:34:19.485 A:middle
and your app only
receives information

686
00:34:19.485 --> 00:34:20.866 A:middle
that is directly relevant to it.

687
00:34:21.775 --> 00:34:24.436 A:middle
Unfortunately, you
have to specify

688
00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:26.196 A:middle
which locations are
interesting to your app

689
00:34:26.196 --> 00:34:30.005 A:middle
and that won't exactly work for
our use case because we want

690
00:34:30.005 --> 00:34:30.835 A:middle
to know about all

691
00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:33.196 A:middle
of the interesting
locations the user might go to

692
00:34:33.536 --> 00:34:35.716 A:middle
and there are far too
many interesting places

693
00:34:35.716 --> 00:34:36.916 A:middle
to monitor for them all.

694
00:34:37.485 --> 00:34:41.386 A:middle
So, that's all that
Core Location has today.

695
00:34:41.456 --> 00:34:43.886 A:middle
Do we give up, I have to
give up on my dream app?

696
00:34:44.536 --> 00:34:46.255 A:middle
Not yet. There's another one.

697
00:34:46.516 --> 00:34:49.315 A:middle
We're introducing
today Visit Monitoring.

698
00:34:50.235 --> 00:34:51.886 A:middle
What makes Visit
Monitoring different

699
00:34:51.926 --> 00:34:53.926 A:middle
from the other Core
Location APIs is

700
00:34:53.926 --> 00:34:56.326 A:middle
that it monitors
for destinations.

701
00:34:57.186 --> 00:34:59.206 A:middle
So instead of giving
you information

702
00:34:59.256 --> 00:35:02.286 A:middle
about how the user
got from A to B,

703
00:35:02.286 --> 00:35:05.036 A:middle
it gives you information
about A and B.

704
00:35:06.876 --> 00:35:09.176 A:middle
It will launch your
app when it detects

705
00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:11.426 A:middle
that the user has departed
from a location or arrived

706
00:35:11.426 --> 00:35:14.406 A:middle
at a new one and so
naturally this will require

707
00:35:14.406 --> 00:35:15.456 A:middle
Always authorization.

708
00:35:15.956 --> 00:35:22.156 A:middle
Visit Monitoring is
incredibly power efficient.

709
00:35:22.566 --> 00:35:25.156 A:middle
We employ all sorts of neat
tricks behind the scenes

710
00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:25.876 A:middle
to ensure this.

711
00:35:26.226 --> 00:35:28.616 A:middle
For example, while
the device is asleep,

712
00:35:28.616 --> 00:35:30.676 A:middle
it periodically performs
WiFi scans.

713
00:35:31.716 --> 00:35:34.646 A:middle
If Visit Monitoring is active,
we're able to harvest all

714
00:35:34.646 --> 00:35:36.996 A:middle
of those scans that would
otherwise have not generated

715
00:35:36.996 --> 00:35:39.646 A:middle
locations and use them to
enhance our visit detection.

716
00:35:40.156 --> 00:35:44.056 A:middle
Visit Monitoring is
also opportunistic.

717
00:35:44.686 --> 00:35:47.956 A:middle
So, if your app is using Visit
Monitoring and the user pulls

718
00:35:47.956 --> 00:35:51.156 A:middle
out apps and starts
navigating, all of the locations

719
00:35:51.156 --> 00:35:54.696 A:middle
that maps requests are fed into
the visit detection algorithm

720
00:35:54.746 --> 00:35:58.046 A:middle
and so your app benefits from
other apps' use of location.

721
00:35:59.756 --> 00:36:04.186 A:middle
Finally, it utilizes information
from across the entire system.

722
00:36:04.676 --> 00:36:08.206 A:middle
For example, suppose the
user arrives home and plugs

723
00:36:08.206 --> 00:36:09.646 A:middle
in their phone to
start charging.

724
00:36:10.406 --> 00:36:12.826 A:middle
It's much more likely that
the user would consider this

725
00:36:12.826 --> 00:36:15.216 A:middle
location where they started
charging to be an important part

726
00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:17.956 A:middle
of their day and so
we'll use that as a hint

727
00:36:18.206 --> 00:36:19.906 A:middle
that the user has just
arrived somewhere.

728
00:36:20.726 --> 00:36:23.266 A:middle
When we see hints, we'll
trigger arrival events much

729
00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:23.926 A:middle
more readily.

730
00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:26.846 A:middle
Finally, I'd like to point

731
00:36:26.846 --> 00:36:30.476 A:middle
out that Visit Monitoring
is not tied to landmarks.

732
00:36:30.886 --> 00:36:34.476 A:middle
I mean, when you receive
information about a location,

733
00:36:34.896 --> 00:36:37.386 A:middle
it's not necessarily an
intrinsically interesting

734
00:36:37.386 --> 00:36:40.796 A:middle
location, it's just a
location which is interesting

735
00:36:40.796 --> 00:36:44.376 A:middle
because the user has spent time
there or we've seen some hints

736
00:36:44.556 --> 00:36:46.856 A:middle
which indicate the user
might think it's interesting.

737
00:36:46.856 --> 00:36:52.016 A:middle
So, let's look at what
a visit actually is.

738
00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:56.576 A:middle
Suppose your user has
turned on Visit Monitoring

739
00:36:56.576 --> 00:36:59.226 A:middle
through your app and they
decide they want to go get a cup

740
00:36:59.226 --> 00:37:01.146 A:middle
of coffee, so they start walking

741
00:37:01.146 --> 00:37:02.766 A:middle
from their home to
the coffee shop.

742
00:37:03.696 --> 00:37:06.516 A:middle
At some point, Core Location
will get its first location

743
00:37:06.936 --> 00:37:08.486 A:middle
of the user at the coffee shop.

744
00:37:08.486 --> 00:37:11.276 A:middle
I don't know about you
but I can't see the future

745
00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.726 A:middle
and so Core Location
is going to have

746
00:37:13.776 --> 00:37:15.466 A:middle
to wait a little while
before it can say

747
00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:17.876 A:middle
for sure whether the user is
passing by the coffee shop

748
00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:20.286 A:middle
or whether they're there
to say for some time.

749
00:37:21.096 --> 00:37:24.306 A:middle
After we get a little bit more
data, it becomes clear that yes,

750
00:37:24.666 --> 00:37:27.276 A:middle
the user intends to stay
at the coffee for a while,

751
00:37:27.566 --> 00:37:29.356 A:middle
maybe it's time to
notify some apps.

752
00:37:29.756 --> 00:37:32.446 A:middle
At this point, Core
Location will launch your app

753
00:37:32.446 --> 00:37:34.406 A:middle
and provide it some
information about the arrival.

754
00:37:35.266 --> 00:37:37.346 A:middle
Most importantly, however,
it will do its best

755
00:37:37.346 --> 00:37:39.126 A:middle
to estimate the true
arrival time

756
00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:40.966 A:middle
of the user at the location.

757
00:37:42.076 --> 00:37:43.396 A:middle
Departures work similarly.

758
00:37:44.096 --> 00:37:47.096 A:middle
After some amount of time,
we'll get our last location

759
00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:51.986 A:middle
of the user at the coffee shop,
but Core Location will wait

760
00:37:51.986 --> 00:37:54.176 A:middle
until it gets a little bit
more data until it's sure

761
00:37:54.176 --> 00:37:55.216 A:middle
that the user has left.

762
00:37:55.756 --> 00:37:58.266 A:middle
At that point, we will
wake your app again

763
00:37:58.536 --> 00:38:01.366 A:middle
and we'll provide a departure
notification, doing our best

764
00:38:01.366 --> 00:38:04.326 A:middle
to estimate the true time when
the user left the location.

765
00:38:04.556 --> 00:38:08.316 A:middle
So, let's take a
look at the API.

766
00:38:09.336 --> 00:38:11.616 A:middle
We've added two new methods
to the locationManager,

767
00:38:12.076 --> 00:38:14.456 A:middle
specifically
startMonitoringVisits

768
00:38:14.666 --> 00:38:16.346 A:middle
and stopMonitoringVisits.

769
00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:18.836 A:middle
When we have information
to deliver to your app,

770
00:38:19.136 --> 00:38:20.806 A:middle
we'll do it through
the new delegate method

771
00:38:21.146 --> 00:38:22.766 A:middle
locationManager didVisit.

772
00:38:23.576 --> 00:38:25.916 A:middle
Some of you may have
noticed there's a new class

773
00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:28.586 A:middle
in that method's signature,
specifically CLVisit,

774
00:38:28.746 --> 00:38:29.756 A:middle
so let's take a look at that.

775
00:38:31.046 --> 00:38:32.666 A:middle
CLVisit is a fairly
simple class.

776
00:38:32.956 --> 00:38:34.056 A:middle
It's got four properties.

777
00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:37.286 A:middle
The first two are
arrivalDate and departureDate;

778
00:38:38.076 --> 00:38:39.736 A:middle
these describe when
the user arrived

779
00:38:39.736 --> 00:38:41.376 A:middle
and departed, respectively.

780
00:38:42.726 --> 00:38:45.936 A:middle
The coordinate, which represents
the place the user was visiting,

781
00:38:46.136 --> 00:38:51.006 A:middle
and horizontal accuracy, which
is an estimate of the error

782
00:38:51.006 --> 00:38:53.246 A:middle
on the location,
on the coordinate.

783
00:38:53.746 --> 00:38:57.626 A:middle
A few things you might want to
know about Visit Monitoring.

784
00:38:58.176 --> 00:39:01.466 A:middle
The values of horizontal
accuracy

785
00:39:01.466 --> 00:39:03.976 A:middle
and coordinate may differ
between an arrival event

786
00:39:03.976 --> 00:39:05.146 A:middle
and a departure event.

787
00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:06.996 A:middle
This shouldn't be
too surprising.

788
00:39:07.236 --> 00:39:09.566 A:middle
These are estimates based
on the data we have seen

789
00:39:09.756 --> 00:39:11.446 A:middle
and as we get more
data, we'll be able

790
00:39:11.446 --> 00:39:12.566 A:middle
to produce better estimates.

791
00:39:14.046 --> 00:39:14.886 A:middle
You should also note

792
00:39:15.246 --> 00:39:18.036 A:middle
that horizontal accuracy
should be no worse

793
00:39:18.096 --> 00:39:21.246 A:middle
than the horizontal accuracy
on a WiFi-based position.

794
00:39:21.486 --> 00:39:24.456 A:middle
So, if you find WiFi-based
positions are suitable

795
00:39:24.456 --> 00:39:27.866 A:middle
for your app, Visit Monitoring
will probably produce things

796
00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:28.586 A:middle
of equal value.

797
00:39:31.136 --> 00:39:35.376 A:middle
Naturally, since this is a
background monitoring service,

798
00:39:35.616 --> 00:39:36.746 A:middle
we'll launch your app even

799
00:39:36.746 --> 00:39:38.426 A:middle
if it's been quit,
as Stephen mentioned.

800
00:39:39.696 --> 00:39:43.306 A:middle
In addition, if the phone is
rebooted or your app crashes,

801
00:39:43.306 --> 00:39:44.936 A:middle
we'll still launch
it and provide it

802
00:39:44.936 --> 00:39:45.726 A:middle
with this information.

803
00:39:48.436 --> 00:39:50.896 A:middle
You should also know
that there are cases

804
00:39:50.896 --> 00:39:54.186 A:middle
in which Visit Monitoring might
detect multiple visit events

805
00:39:54.296 --> 00:39:56.196 A:middle
at the same time
and deliver them

806
00:39:56.196 --> 00:39:56.976 A:middle
to your app in a single launch.

807
00:39:57.086 --> 00:39:59.966 A:middle
So, when you receive visits,

808
00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:02.096 A:middle
you should be prepared
to handle multiple.

809
00:40:02.646 --> 00:40:07.476 A:middle
You may have noticed that
CLVisit doesn't have a isArrival

810
00:40:07.476 --> 00:40:10.506 A:middle
or isDeparture property,
so let's take a look

811
00:40:10.506 --> 00:40:13.096 A:middle
at how you can determine whether
a visit represents an arrival

812
00:40:13.096 --> 00:40:15.186 A:middle
event or departure event.

813
00:40:16.176 --> 00:40:18.776 A:middle
The secret is to look
at the arrival date

814
00:40:18.776 --> 00:40:20.066 A:middle
and departure date properties.

815
00:40:20.996 --> 00:40:22.446 A:middle
On an arrival notification,

816
00:40:23.026 --> 00:40:25.576 A:middle
the arrival date will
unsurprisingly be our best

817
00:40:25.576 --> 00:40:27.336 A:middle
estimate of when
the user arrived.

818
00:40:27.886 --> 00:40:31.186 A:middle
The departure date, however,
will be NSDate distantFuture.

819
00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:34.046 A:middle
On a departure notification,

820
00:40:34.346 --> 00:40:36.486 A:middle
the departure date will
be our best estimate.

821
00:40:37.786 --> 00:40:39.946 A:middle
The arrival date, I'd
like to point out,

822
00:40:40.216 --> 00:40:41.956 A:middle
could be distant past.

823
00:40:42.096 --> 00:40:44.326 A:middle
This happens if your
app wasn't authorized

824
00:40:44.326 --> 00:40:46.086 A:middle
for the arrival moment.

825
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:51.046 A:middle
So, how do we check if a
CLVisit represents an arrival

826
00:40:51.046 --> 00:40:51.736 A:middle
or a departure?

827
00:40:52.686 --> 00:40:55.456 A:middle
You simply compare the departure
date to distant future.

828
00:40:56.616 --> 00:40:58.106 A:middle
Now, let's get back to that app.

829
00:40:58.996 --> 00:41:02.196 A:middle
There should be four
steps to implementing it.

830
00:41:03.286 --> 00:41:05.966 A:middle
First, we need to adopt
the new authorization model

831
00:41:05.966 --> 00:41:06.936 A:middle
that Stephen described.

832
00:41:07.526 --> 00:41:10.786 A:middle
After that, we need to
create our locationManager,

833
00:41:11.616 --> 00:41:12.946 A:middle
write our start and
stop methods,

834
00:41:13.476 --> 00:41:15.726 A:middle
and finally handle the visits

835
00:41:16.016 --> 00:41:17.476 A:middle
that are delivered
by Core Location.

836
00:41:20.296 --> 00:41:22.756 A:middle
Adopting the new authorization
isn't too difficult.

837
00:41:23.146 --> 00:41:26.226 A:middle
The hardest part is coming up
with a great way to describe

838
00:41:26.226 --> 00:41:28.326 A:middle
to your users how you intend
to use their location.

839
00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:31.246 A:middle
For this example,
journaling app, we might say,

840
00:41:31.466 --> 00:41:32.726 A:middle
this app needs your location

841
00:41:32.726 --> 00:41:35.226 A:middle
to automatically detect
the places you visit during

842
00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:35.636 A:middle
your day.

843
00:41:36.396 --> 00:41:40.756 A:middle
After that, we create
our locationManager.

844
00:41:41.276 --> 00:41:44.006 A:middle
I went ahead and did that
in the application delegate

845
00:41:44.496 --> 00:41:47.066 A:middle
because it provides a
great main thread context

846
00:41:47.066 --> 00:41:48.776 A:middle
for us to allocate it in.

847
00:41:50.376 --> 00:41:52.526 A:middle
The start and stop
methods are fairly simple.

848
00:41:52.816 --> 00:41:54.316 A:middle
The only catch is
you have to remember

849
00:41:54.316 --> 00:41:55.876 A:middle
to requestAlwaysAuthorization.

850
00:41:56.956 --> 00:42:00.516 A:middle
And the stop is even easier, you
just call stopMonitoringVisits.

851
00:42:01.956 --> 00:42:06.186 A:middle
Finally, the delegate, this
is where you take over.

852
00:42:06.716 --> 00:42:09.786 A:middle
Please keep in mind

853
00:42:10.046 --> 00:42:13.356 A:middle
that background execution time
is limited and, as I mentioned,

854
00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:14.976 A:middle
you may receive multiple visits.

855
00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:17.686 A:middle
So you shouldn't kick
off some long-running,

856
00:42:17.796 --> 00:42:21.186 A:middle
computationally-expensive
processing task here.

857
00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:23.946 A:middle
For a simple journaling
app, it might be best

858
00:42:23.946 --> 00:42:27.596 A:middle
to just record this visit in
a database and then save it

859
00:42:27.596 --> 00:42:30.426 A:middle
for later when the user
actually launches your app.

860
00:42:31.316 --> 00:42:34.676 A:middle
If you're writing a check-in
app, now might be a good time

861
00:42:35.056 --> 00:42:37.696 A:middle
to take a look at the location,
see if it's accurate enough

862
00:42:37.696 --> 00:42:40.366 A:middle
for you to actually
determine if the user is

863
00:42:40.366 --> 00:42:43.066 A:middle
at a specific restaurant,
for example,

864
00:42:43.296 --> 00:42:46.726 A:middle
and then maybe fire off a
UILocalNotification saying would

865
00:42:46.726 --> 00:42:48.236 A:middle
you like to check in.

866
00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:53.746 A:middle
Before I give the
stage back to Stephen,

867
00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:56.566 A:middle
I'd like to give you some advice
from the Core Location team

868
00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:57.576 A:middle
about Visit Monitoring.

869
00:42:58.516 --> 00:43:00.826 A:middle
Visit Monitoring is
not a replacement

870
00:43:01.016 --> 00:43:02.056 A:middle
for region monitoring.

871
00:43:02.286 --> 00:43:04.096 A:middle
If you're currently
using region monitoring

872
00:43:04.096 --> 00:43:08.266 A:middle
to receive useful information
about the user arriving at

873
00:43:08.266 --> 00:43:10.226 A:middle
or departing from
specific locations,

874
00:43:10.456 --> 00:43:11.996 A:middle
you should continue to do so.

875
00:43:12.376 --> 00:43:14.306 A:middle
Region monitoring is
more power efficient

876
00:43:14.396 --> 00:43:17.826 A:middle
and will give you more timely
information about those events.

877
00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:22.836 A:middle
In addition, Visit
Monitoring is not a replacement

878
00:43:22.836 --> 00:43:24.276 A:middle
for significant location
changes.

879
00:43:24.626 --> 00:43:26.426 A:middle
They provide you very
different information.

880
00:43:26.756 --> 00:43:29.786 A:middle
Significant location changes
is about the path the user too,

881
00:43:30.196 --> 00:43:32.846 A:middle
whereas Visit Monitoring
is about the destinations.

882
00:43:35.556 --> 00:43:38.286 A:middle
So, what do you do when you
encounter new technology,

883
00:43:38.286 --> 00:43:41.516 A:middle
you should try it out and
evaluate it for your use case.

884
00:43:41.976 --> 00:43:45.976 A:middle
See if Visit Monitoring covers
something that your app needs.

885
00:43:46.876 --> 00:43:50.836 A:middle
Then, on Thursday,
we're hosting a lab.

886
00:43:51.456 --> 00:43:52.766 A:middle
You should come to
our lab session,

887
00:43:52.826 --> 00:43:54.576 A:middle
bring any questions
you might have,

888
00:43:54.576 --> 00:43:56.186 A:middle
any problems you might
have encountered,

889
00:43:56.346 --> 00:44:00.376 A:middle
and we'll do our best to help
you get your app up and running.

890
00:44:00.426 --> 00:44:04.686 A:middle
Finally, please respect
your users' privacy.

891
00:44:05.266 --> 00:44:07.086 A:middle
This is an incredible technology

892
00:44:07.086 --> 00:44:09.676 A:middle
that will give your app a new
level of location awareness

893
00:44:10.236 --> 00:44:14.726 A:middle
but you should try to
respect your users' privacy.

894
00:44:14.726 --> 00:44:16.436 A:middle
Just because you can
obtain this data,

895
00:44:16.436 --> 00:44:18.106 A:middle
doesn't mean you
necessarily should.

896
00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:22.226 A:middle
If you have any questions,
there's going to be a session

897
00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.836 A:middle
about security and
privacy later this week.

898
00:44:24.836 --> 00:44:26.586 A:middle
I highly recommend
you attend it.

899
00:44:27.556 --> 00:44:30.286 A:middle
With that, I'd like to invite
Stephen back up onto the stage

900
00:44:30.286 --> 00:44:32.336 A:middle
to tell you about what's next.

901
00:44:32.756 --> 00:44:33.446 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Brad.

902
00:44:33.876 --> 00:44:36.466 A:middle
So what else is new in
Core Location on iOS 8?

903
00:44:37.726 --> 00:44:39.806 A:middle
Well there was that third
bullet point we talked about,

904
00:44:39.806 --> 00:44:40.726 A:middle
Indoor Positioning.

905
00:44:41.286 --> 00:44:42.886 A:middle
Unfortunately, we
don't have enough time

906
00:44:42.886 --> 00:44:44.006 A:middle
to cover that in this session.

907
00:44:44.346 --> 00:44:47.596 A:middle
In summary, we talked about
location authorization

908
00:44:47.596 --> 00:44:50.436 A:middle
and changes and recall that
there are just three steps

909
00:44:50.436 --> 00:44:53.336 A:middle
that you need to follow to
adopt the changes in iOS 8.

910
00:44:53.976 --> 00:44:56.636 A:middle
First, you want to think about
how your app uses location.

911
00:44:57.356 --> 00:44:59.266 A:middle
Second, you want to
explain it to your users.

912
00:44:59.946 --> 00:45:03.336 A:middle
And third, you want to make the
call to request authorization.
