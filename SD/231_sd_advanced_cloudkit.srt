00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:16.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hi. Welcome to the
Advanced CloudKit session.

2
00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:20.546 A:middle
[ Cheering &amp; Applause ]

3
00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:21.416 A:middle
Thank you.

4
00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:23.526 A:middle
My name is Jacob Farkas.

5
00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:25.496 A:middle
I'm a Software Engineer
at Apple and one

6
00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:26.896 A:middle
of the designers of
the CloudKit API.

7
00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:29.766 A:middle
And my colleagues and I
have put a lot of hard work

8
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.706 A:middle
into the CloudKit API.

9
00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:33.356 A:middle
I'm really excited to talk
to you guys about it today.

10
00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:35.306 A:middle
So, let's jump right into it.

11
00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:40.616 A:middle
So, CloudKit is this thing
that we've built on top

12
00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:41.886 A:middle
of our iCloud servers.

13
00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:45.286 A:middle
We've built a lot of iCloud
services, and what we're doing

14
00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:48.626 A:middle
with CloudKit is exposing those
database servers that we use

15
00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:51.246 A:middle
at Apple to all of
you developers.

16
00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:54.026 A:middle
So, we're actually using this.

17
00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:56.796 A:middle
This is something that we
use in the new iCloud Photos

18
00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:58.956 A:middle
and iCloud Drive feature
that we're introducing,

19
00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:02.366 A:middle
and we're building all of
that on top of CloudKit.

20
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.056 A:middle
If all of this is unfamiliar to
you, you might want to go back

21
00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:08.206 A:middle
and check out the
Introducing CloudKit session.

22
00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.506 A:middle
It was given on Tuesday and
there should be videos online.

23
00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:14.306 A:middle
So, we're going to
jump right into this.

24
00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:15.886 A:middle
What we're going to learn today,

25
00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:18.736 A:middle
we're going to over the CloudKit
private database, which is a way

26
00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:21.236 A:middle
for you store private user
information in iCloud.

27
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.386 A:middle
We're going to talk about
modeling your data in CloudKit.

28
00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:27.956 A:middle
We're going to talk about
advanced record manipulation

29
00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:30.066 A:middle
and different ways of saving
records to the server.

30
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.276 A:middle
We're going to go over how to
handle notifications reliably,

31
00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:36.156 A:middle
if you miss a push, what to do.

32
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.866 A:middle
And finally, we're going to
go over the iCloud Dashboard

33
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.456 A:middle
which is a web-based interface

34
00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:43.126 A:middle
for managing your
CloudKit application.

35
00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:47.246 A:middle
So, let's start off by looking

36
00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:48.916 A:middle
at the CloudKit API
really quick.

37
00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:53.606 A:middle
We designed the CloudKit API
to be highly asynchronous.

38
00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:57.416 A:middle
Everything has a callback,
nothing is synchronous.

39
00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:59.056 A:middle
And we did this because all

40
00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.836 A:middle
of these requests are
going out over the network.

41
00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:03.686 A:middle
When you get the network
involved, anything can happen,

42
00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:06.446 A:middle
you know, the server might
not be responding quickly,

43
00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.036 A:middle
there might be a bad
network connection.

44
00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:11.736 A:middle
We don't want to block the UI
and cause a bad user experience.

45
00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:16.036 A:middle
And to help do this, we've used
NSOperation almost everywhere

46
00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:16.516 A:middle
in our API.

47
00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:20.636 A:middle
I say almost everywhere
because if you went

48
00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:21.986 A:middle
to the introductory session,

49
00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:24.406 A:middle
you remember seeing what we
called the Convenience API.

50
00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:29.086 A:middle
And the Convenience API is our
way of helping you get started

51
00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:30.916 A:middle
with CloudKit really
quickly and simply.

52
00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:35.046 A:middle
All of these APIs are, you
know, single calls that work

53
00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:36.986 A:middle
on one record at a time.

54
00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:39.116 A:middle
So, in this case, we're
fetching one record

55
00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:41.076 A:middle
and it's asynchronous.

56
00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:43.286 A:middle
We get that one record back
in our completionHandler.

57
00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:46.496 A:middle
But, as you use CloudKit
more, you might find

58
00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:48.026 A:middle
that you need some
additional functionality.

59
00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:51.376 A:middle
And that's where the
NSOperation-based API comes in.

60
00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.506 A:middle
So, what we've got here is
the CKFetchRecordsOperation.

61
00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:58.696 A:middle
And this is an NSOperation
that does the equivalent

62
00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.436 A:middle
of that convenience
API we just saw.

63
00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.656 A:middle
We give you a lot
more functionality

64
00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:04.996 A:middle
when you use the
NSOperation-based API.

65
00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:09.316 A:middle
So, you can see here that our
initializer takes an array

66
00:03:09.316 --> 00:03:09.876 A:middle
of record IDs.

67
00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:13.046 A:middle
You can fetch a whole batch
of records all at once.

68
00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:16.296 A:middle
We also give you more
feedback on what's happening.

69
00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.886 A:middle
We've got a completion
block for each record,

70
00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:20.326 A:middle
and we also give you progress

71
00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:22.056 A:middle
as we download those
records from the server.

72
00:03:22.646 --> 00:03:28.306 A:middle
And finally, these operations
give you more knobs and levers

73
00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:32.196 A:middle
to tweak what is returned
and what the operation does.

74
00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:34.816 A:middle
In this case, we've got
a desiredKeys property

75
00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:36.916 A:middle
that lets you specify
what key should come back

76
00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:40.436 A:middle
on the records that you fetch.

77
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:43.086 A:middle
So, since all of this
is built on NSOperation,

78
00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:44.176 A:middle
let's do a quick overview

79
00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:46.366 A:middle
of what the NSOperation
class looks like.

80
00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:50.446 A:middle
What we've got in NSOperation
is a completionBlock

81
00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.176 A:middle
and a cancel call so that
you can manage the life cycle

82
00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:53.946 A:middle
of your operation.

83
00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:56.586 A:middle
We've got a couple of variables

84
00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:58.606 A:middle
that tell you some state
about the operation.

85
00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:01.916 A:middle
And NSOperations
have dependencies,

86
00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:04.376 A:middle
so you can link two
NSOperations together.

87
00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:09.336 A:middle
Once you have an NSOperation,
you're going to want to start

88
00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:11.566 A:middle
that operation, and you
do that by adding it

89
00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.266 A:middle
to an NSOperationQueue.

90
00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:16.276 A:middle
When you have an
NSOperationQueue,

91
00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:19.276 A:middle
you can also manage the life
cycle of that operation queue.

92
00:04:19.276 --> 00:04:21.156 A:middle
You can suspend it
and resume it,

93
00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.826 A:middle
and you can cancel
the operations in it.

94
00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:28.836 A:middle
So, if you go to look at
our NSOperation-based API,

95
00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:30.906 A:middle
you might just see this
big list of a bunch

96
00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:32.026 A:middle
of different operations.

97
00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:33.896 A:middle
It's kind of overwhelming
and confusing.

98
00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:36.796 A:middle
The best way to think
about this API is to think

99
00:04:36.796 --> 00:04:38.736 A:middle
about the objects that
you want to deal with.

100
00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:41.076 A:middle
If you remember from
the introductory talk,

101
00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:44.936 A:middle
CloudKits-based objects
are records and zones

102
00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:48.546 A:middle
and subscriptions, and you'll
see that up here we have a fetch

103
00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:50.926 A:middle
and a modify operation
for all of those items.

104
00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:57.476 A:middle
One of the really cool
things about NSOperation is

105
00:04:57.476 --> 00:04:58.616 A:middle
that is has dependencies.

106
00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:01.656 A:middle
So, you can set a dependency
between two operations

107
00:05:02.226 --> 00:05:04.506 A:middle
and the second operation
won't fire

108
00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:06.226 A:middle
until the first operation
is completed.

109
00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:09.796 A:middle
This is really handy
with CloudKit if you want

110
00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:13.146 A:middle
to do something like fetch a
record, add a property to it,

111
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.936 A:middle
and save that record
back to the server.

112
00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:17.696 A:middle
You can make the
FetchRecordsOperation,

113
00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:21.646 A:middle
make the modify operation at the
same time, set up a dependency,

114
00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:24.046 A:middle
and when the fetch completes,
you can put that data

115
00:05:24.046 --> 00:05:26.286 A:middle
in the modify operation, and
it'll start automatically.

116
00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:30.786 A:middle
These dependencies also
work between queues.

117
00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:34.566 A:middle
So, even though CloudKit has
its own internal operation queue

118
00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:37.006 A:middle
that you can use to run
operations, you're welcome

119
00:05:37.326 --> 00:05:39.486 A:middle
to create your own
NSOperation queue,

120
00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:41.436 A:middle
and you can then
manage its life cycle.

121
00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:47.716 A:middle
You can stop operations or
suspend them or cancel them.

122
00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:51.326 A:middle
One tip with using
NSOperation though is

123
00:05:51.326 --> 00:05:55.146 A:middle
that the NSOperation-based class
has a completionBlock on it.

124
00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:56.926 A:middle
This completionBlock ends

125
00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:59.496 A:middle
up firing asynchronously
with dependencies.

126
00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:01.056 A:middle
So, if you've set
up dependencies

127
00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:03.466 A:middle
and you're using the
NSOperation's completion block,

128
00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.586 A:middle
they might happen
at the same time,

129
00:06:05.996 --> 00:06:07.586 A:middle
and that data you
were trying to funnel

130
00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:10.596 A:middle
into the next operation won't
get there in time, you know,

131
00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:11.876 A:middle
that operation has
already started.

132
00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:15.056 A:middle
So, what we've done with
the CloudKit API is we have

133
00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:16.996 A:middle
CloudKit-specific
completion blocks.

134
00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:21.316 A:middle
And if we look at what we had
for that fetchRecords operation,

135
00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:23.766 A:middle
we have a
fetchRecordsCompletionBlock.

136
00:06:24.456 --> 00:06:26.946 A:middle
You'll see this pattern on
all of our NSOperations.

137
00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:29.366 A:middle
And these completion
blocks hand back all

138
00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:30.906 A:middle
of the information
you needed to know

139
00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:32.286 A:middle
about the operation
that just ran.

140
00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:35.756 A:middle
In this case, we've got the
errors for that operation,

141
00:06:35.756 --> 00:06:38.396 A:middle
and we've also got the
records that were fetched.

142
00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:43.146 A:middle
And finally, NSOperations can
have their own priorities.

143
00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:45.856 A:middle
So, you can set background
operations and have them run

144
00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:48.656 A:middle
at a really low priority
and keep your UI responsive.

145
00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:52.226 A:middle
So, when we were
designing CloudKit,

146
00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:53.406 A:middle
one of the things we noticed is

147
00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.546 A:middle
that there's two general
classes of applications.

148
00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:59.816 A:middle
There's one class of application
that stores a whole bunch

149
00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:02.836 A:middle
of data up on the server, and
when you use the application,

150
00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:04.476 A:middle
it's just presenting
the view of that data.

151
00:07:04.476 --> 00:07:07.556 A:middle
It downloads it on demand,
displays it to the user,

152
00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:10.096 A:middle
and then, you know,
tosses it out because it's,

153
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.446 A:middle
the real copy's on the server.

154
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.866 A:middle
But there's another
class of application

155
00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:16.346 A:middle
that has just a little
bit of data, but you want

156
00:07:16.346 --> 00:07:18.376 A:middle
that same data on
all of your clients.

157
00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:21.536 A:middle
So, if you remember from
the introductory talk,

158
00:07:21.536 --> 00:07:24.446 A:middle
we talked about what we
called Big Data, Little Phone.

159
00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:26.826 A:middle
That's that case where we have
a lot of data on the server.

160
00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:30.156 A:middle
It's not all going to fit on
one phone, and you download it

161
00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:31.196 A:middle
and view it on demand.

162
00:07:31.456 --> 00:07:33.886 A:middle
So, you can see these clients
are downloading records,

163
00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:37.156 A:middle
viewing them, and the truth
lives up on the server.

164
00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:40.966 A:middle
However, there's another
class of application,

165
00:07:41.626 --> 00:07:43.686 A:middle
where it's a small
amount of data.

166
00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:46.816 A:middle
It lives on one client, but you
want it on all your clients.

167
00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:48.986 A:middle
An example of this
is an application

168
00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:50.076 A:middle
that manages your receipts.

169
00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:53.836 A:middle
So, every time you buy
something, you take a picture

170
00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:57.846 A:middle
of the receipt, and you want
that information on your phone,

171
00:07:57.846 --> 00:08:00.746 A:middle
in your iPad, in your Mac,
and you want them all to be

172
00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:02.306 A:middle
up to date with the
same receipts.

173
00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.556 A:middle
So, what we've done
to help you solve

174
00:08:07.556 --> 00:08:11.146 A:middle
that is we've got something
in CloudKit that does that.

175
00:08:11.146 --> 00:08:13.946 A:middle
If you remember, we have, every
application gets a container.

176
00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:17.146 A:middle
In every container is a
public and private database.

177
00:08:18.016 --> 00:08:20.296 A:middle
And just as a refresher,

178
00:08:20.296 --> 00:08:22.676 A:middle
that private database is
actually one private database

179
00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:23.476 A:middle
for every user.

180
00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:27.516 A:middle
Inside of those databases,

181
00:08:27.516 --> 00:08:29.196 A:middle
we then subdivide
them down into zones.

182
00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:32.706 A:middle
So, both the public and the
private database have a default

183
00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:33.265 A:middle
zone in them.

184
00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:37.275 A:middle
But we've also given you
what we call custom zones,

185
00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:40.486 A:middle
and these custom zones allow us
to give you some extra features

186
00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.816 A:middle
that we can't provide
in the default zones.

187
00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:47.786 A:middle
You can create these custom
zones and use the new features.

188
00:08:47.846 --> 00:08:50.556 A:middle
Let's go over a couple of them.

189
00:08:50.756 --> 00:08:53.246 A:middle
The first feature
is atomic commits.

190
00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:57.286 A:middle
So, CloudKit has
relationships between records.

191
00:08:57.286 --> 00:09:00.596 A:middle
And if you start using CloudKit
and using these relationships,

192
00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:03.476 A:middle
you're going to build up an
object graph, and you're going

193
00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:06.966 A:middle
to realize you want
consistency in your data.

194
00:09:06.966 --> 00:09:09.466 A:middle
If, you know, you might have
an object graph that you want

195
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.556 A:middle
to commit all at once.

196
00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:13.186 A:middle
And if some of those
things don't get committed,

197
00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:15.996 A:middle
the data on the server
doesn't make sense.

198
00:09:16.296 --> 00:09:18.296 A:middle
On the public database,
we can't guarantee

199
00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:20.616 A:middle
that because there might
be thousands or millions

200
00:09:20.616 --> 00:09:22.246 A:middle
of users hitting
the same database.

201
00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:25.496 A:middle
So, there's no way to lock the
database while we, you know,

202
00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:27.106 A:middle
commit your very
special records.

203
00:09:27.916 --> 00:09:31.416 A:middle
But in the private database,
you only have one user.

204
00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:33.156 A:middle
It's the current user's account.

205
00:09:33.196 --> 00:09:40.506 A:middle
And in that case, we can provide
you things like atomic commits.

206
00:09:40.586 --> 00:09:43.176 A:middle
So, with atomic commits,
these batch operations

207
00:09:43.206 --> 00:09:46.726 A:middle
in the NSOperation API will
succeed or fail as a whole.

208
00:09:47.106 --> 00:09:49.216 A:middle
So, if any record had a problem,

209
00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:52.886 A:middle
you will get back a
CKErrorPartialFailure.

210
00:09:54.546 --> 00:09:56.846 A:middle
Inside of that partial
failure error, you're going

211
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.526 A:middle
to see a user, the
userInfo dictionary is going

212
00:09:59.576 --> 00:10:02.246 A:middle
to have this
CKPartialErrorsByItemID key.

213
00:10:03.386 --> 00:10:05.796 A:middle
And that's going to be a
dictionary of record IDs

214
00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:08.336 A:middle
to errors for each
of those records.

215
00:10:09.116 --> 00:10:10.556 A:middle
And some of those
errors are going

216
00:10:10.556 --> 00:10:12.416 A:middle
to be the real failures
that you care about.

217
00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:14.636 A:middle
These are the reasons that
the atomic commit failed.

218
00:10:15.376 --> 00:10:17.486 A:middle
But, you know, the rest
of the records failed

219
00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:19.726 A:middle
because it was atomic commit,
and we need to let you know

220
00:10:19.726 --> 00:10:21.476 A:middle
that they failed,
so you're also going

221
00:10:21.556 --> 00:10:23.576 A:middle
to see
CKErrorBatchRequestFailed.

222
00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:26.006 A:middle
That's just a way of
saying that something else

223
00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:27.816 A:middle
in this batch failed,
and, you know,

224
00:10:27.816 --> 00:10:32.726 A:middle
this wasn't the real problem, it
was that other record in here.

225
00:10:32.946 --> 00:10:34.466 A:middle
Another great feature
that we give you

226
00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:36.566 A:middle
with custom zones
are delta downloads.

227
00:10:37.946 --> 00:10:40.656 A:middle
So, delta downloads are a
way for that second class

228
00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:43.586 A:middle
of application to be
possible in CloudKit.

229
00:10:43.966 --> 00:10:46.456 A:middle
You can download only the
changes that were made

230
00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:48.996 A:middle
in that zone, and you can
cache them all locally.

231
00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:51.926 A:middle
So, what does that look like?

232
00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:55.306 A:middle
Well, we've got our Mac here,
and we've got our iPhone,

233
00:10:55.736 --> 00:10:57.126 A:middle
and we've got a custom zone.

234
00:10:57.936 --> 00:11:00.096 A:middle
So, let's step through a
delta download really quick.

235
00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:02.966 A:middle
We've got an orange
record and a green record

236
00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:05.496 A:middle
over on the Mac here, and we
want them on the phone as well.

237
00:11:05.856 --> 00:11:08.346 A:middle
So, we're going to first
upload those both into CloudKit

238
00:11:08.346 --> 00:11:12.346 A:middle
in our custom zone, and
then our iPhone is going

239
00:11:12.346 --> 00:11:15.946 A:middle
to perform a delta
download to get up to date.

240
00:11:17.456 --> 00:11:19.396 A:middle
So, these delta downloads
are based

241
00:11:19.396 --> 00:11:20.836 A:middle
on what we call change tokens.

242
00:11:20.836 --> 00:11:23.406 A:middle
And a change token is a
way of tracking the state

243
00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:25.226 A:middle
of the server the last
time you talked to it.

244
00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:28.256 A:middle
So, this phone has never
talked to the server,

245
00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:31.536 A:middle
and what it's going to do is
send up a nil change token.

246
00:11:31.536 --> 00:11:33.466 A:middle
And that's a way of saying,
"I've never talked to you,

247
00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:35.216 A:middle
just send me all the
records in the zone."

248
00:11:36.106 --> 00:11:38.176 A:middle
So, the server is the going
to take that nil change token,

249
00:11:38.936 --> 00:11:41.376 A:middle
send down an, the orange
record and green record.

250
00:11:41.876 --> 00:11:44.056 A:middle
The phone is going to save
them into its local database.

251
00:11:44.646 --> 00:11:47.106 A:middle
And then the server is going to
send down a new change token.

252
00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:50.466 A:middle
In this case, it's change
token A, and that means that,

253
00:11:50.466 --> 00:11:53.566 A:middle
you know, the records you
have are all from state A.

254
00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:56.766 A:middle
If the phone came back
again with change tag A,

255
00:11:56.766 --> 00:11:58.296 A:middle
the server will go, "Well,
I don't have anything

256
00:11:58.296 --> 00:11:59.856 A:middle
for you, A is good enough.

257
00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:00.916 A:middle
There's nothing to download."

258
00:12:01.446 --> 00:12:05.796 A:middle
But let's say the Mac
comes along and it creates

259
00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:08.386 A:middle
that purple record, and it
deletes the green record.

260
00:12:08.626 --> 00:12:10.736 A:middle
And it uploads those
changes to the server.

261
00:12:11.716 --> 00:12:14.076 A:middle
The server is going to track
the changes, so it'll note

262
00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:15.476 A:middle
that that green record
was deleted.

263
00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:17.346 A:middle
It'll note that there's
a new purple record.

264
00:12:18.106 --> 00:12:20.566 A:middle
And now, when the iPhone
comes back with change tag A,

265
00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:23.786 A:middle
the server goes, "All right,
well, we're are at B now.

266
00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:25.086 A:middle
That's farther than A.

267
00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:27.336 A:middle
Here's a delete of
the green record

268
00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:30.136 A:middle
and here's a new purple record
that happened while, you know,

269
00:12:30.136 --> 00:12:31.286 A:middle
since the last time we talked."

270
00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.696 A:middle
Then it sends back
that new change token

271
00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:37.026 A:middle
and everyone is up to date.

272
00:12:38.356 --> 00:12:40.526 A:middle
So, you can use this
delta download

273
00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:43.016 A:middle
to implement an offline
cache in your application.

274
00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:46.146 A:middle
If you want to do
that, there's a couple

275
00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:47.156 A:middle
of steps your app
should to take.

276
00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:49.936 A:middle
This is kind of an outline
of a basic state machine

277
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.196 A:middle
for every time you talk
to the server and you want

278
00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:53.146 A:middle
to do a delta download.

279
00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:56.776 A:middle
The first thing you're going
to want to do in your app is

280
00:12:56.846 --> 00:12:58.456 A:middle
to track the local changes.

281
00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:00.716 A:middle
You're going to want
to make a change table,

282
00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:03.966 A:middle
and every time the user makes
an edit in your application,

283
00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:04.916 A:middle
you want to write that down.

284
00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:07.766 A:middle
You're going to want to do this
because you might be offline

285
00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:10.266 A:middle
when the user makes the changes,
and you're going to need

286
00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:12.496 A:middle
to replay all those
changes back to the server

287
00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:14.106 A:middle
when you can talk to it.

288
00:13:16.116 --> 00:13:17.166 A:middle
Then, you're going to need

289
00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:19.046 A:middle
to send all those
changes up to the server.

290
00:13:19.046 --> 00:13:21.006 A:middle
You want to do that before
you fetch the changes

291
00:13:21.056 --> 00:13:23.666 A:middle
because someone else might
have changed the record

292
00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:26.356 A:middle
in the meantime, and you need
to resolve these conflicts.

293
00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:29.776 A:middle
So, we'll go over conflict
handling in just a little bit,

294
00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:31.196 A:middle
but just keep in mind

295
00:13:31.196 --> 00:13:33.186 A:middle
that that's an important
step in this process here.

296
00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:37.086 A:middle
Finally, you're ready to
do the delta download.

297
00:13:37.086 --> 00:13:38.146 A:middle
This is the point
where you're going

298
00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:40.526 A:middle
to call
CKFetchRecordChangesOperation.

299
00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:45.576 A:middle
The server is going to send
you back updates and deletes

300
00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:48.766 A:middle
and modifies and adds of
records, and you're going

301
00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:50.496 A:middle
to save those into
your local database.

302
00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:53.016 A:middle
Finally, the server is going

303
00:13:53.016 --> 00:13:54.646 A:middle
to send you back a
new change token.

304
00:13:54.716 --> 00:13:56.396 A:middle
And that's the change
token you want to save

305
00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:58.296 A:middle
so that the next time
you talk to the server,

306
00:13:58.746 --> 00:13:59.916 A:middle
you can get only the records

307
00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:01.646 A:middle
that have changed
and not everything.

308
00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:07.296 A:middle
So, one of the other features
we give you with custom zones

309
00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:09.346 A:middle
and delta downloads
are zone subscriptions.

310
00:14:09.346 --> 00:14:12.956 A:middle
In the case of that state
machine I just talked about,

311
00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:16.376 A:middle
you could pull every, you
know, 10 minutes or 5 minutes

312
00:14:16.376 --> 00:14:18.466 A:middle
or whatever and hope that
there are changes up there.

313
00:14:19.136 --> 00:14:21.256 A:middle
But wouldn't it be great if
the server just told you,

314
00:14:21.256 --> 00:14:22.226 A:middle
"Hey, I've got changes.

315
00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:23.356 A:middle
It's time for delta download."

316
00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:24.816 A:middle
Well, we give you that.

317
00:14:24.886 --> 00:14:27.296 A:middle
We give you what we
call zone subscriptions.

318
00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.646 A:middle
These look like query
subscriptions,

319
00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:30.826 A:middle
but they're a little
bit different.

320
00:14:31.586 --> 00:14:34.746 A:middle
What they do is every
time something changes

321
00:14:34.746 --> 00:14:37.336 A:middle
in a custom zone, you'll
get a push notification.

322
00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:39.556 A:middle
When you see that
push notification,

323
00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:42.056 A:middle
you know you should go do a
delta download with the server,

324
00:14:42.366 --> 00:14:43.456 A:middle
and you'll get new records.

325
00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:50.696 A:middle
So, a couple of notes on
designing custom zones

326
00:14:50.696 --> 00:14:51.716 A:middle
and when you should use them.

327
00:14:52.956 --> 00:14:56.206 A:middle
These custom zones are meant
to compartmentalize your data.

328
00:14:56.656 --> 00:14:59.696 A:middle
Because of that, there's a
couple of restrictions on them.

329
00:14:59.696 --> 00:15:02.416 A:middle
The first is that you can't
move records between zones.

330
00:15:03.226 --> 00:15:05.096 A:middle
You can pick these
records up and copy them

331
00:15:05.096 --> 00:15:09.806 A:middle
and make a new copy in the new
zone, but you can't move them.

332
00:15:09.806 --> 00:15:12.676 A:middle
You also can't make
any cross-zone delete

333
00:15:12.676 --> 00:15:13.916 A:middle
self relationships.

334
00:15:14.006 --> 00:15:17.656 A:middle
So, you have to think of
these zones as self-contained.

335
00:15:17.656 --> 00:15:20.096 A:middle
If you have records that need to
go across zones, you might want

336
00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:21.086 A:middle
to rethink your model.

337
00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:26.306 A:middle
And finally, these zones
determine the level of updates.

338
00:15:26.306 --> 00:15:28.476 A:middle
If you're using a zone
subscription, you're going

339
00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:30.976 A:middle
to get a push every single
time something has changed

340
00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:31.526 A:middle
in that zone.

341
00:15:31.526 --> 00:15:36.006 A:middle
If you have a lot of data on
the server and you only care

342
00:15:36.006 --> 00:15:38.196 A:middle
about getting updates for
one part of that data,

343
00:15:38.196 --> 00:15:41.486 A:middle
you might want to make that a
zone so that you can ignore the,

344
00:15:41.486 --> 00:15:43.956 A:middle
you know, really busy
stuff going on over here

345
00:15:43.956 --> 00:15:51.236 A:middle
and just download the
things you care about.

346
00:15:52.276 --> 00:15:54.776 A:middle
So, let's talk about some
advanced record operations.

347
00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:59.266 A:middle
When you're using CKRecord,
any changes you make

348
00:15:59.266 --> 00:16:03.676 A:middle
to a CKRecord object locally get
tracked, and then when we talk

349
00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:06.076 A:middle
to the server, we're only
going to send the changes

350
00:16:06.076 --> 00:16:07.466 A:middle
that you made to that CKRecord.

351
00:16:08.636 --> 00:16:10.926 A:middle
This is the default behavior,
and it works great most

352
00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:14.286 A:middle
of the time, but you might
want some additional control

353
00:16:14.286 --> 00:16:15.906 A:middle
over what we're sending
to the server.

354
00:16:16.666 --> 00:16:18.606 A:middle
And we give you that
with save policies.

355
00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:23.156 A:middle
So, these save policies,
we have three of them.

356
00:16:23.276 --> 00:16:25.226 A:middle
They're
CKRecordSaveIfServerUnchanged.

357
00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:32.046 A:middle
We have CKRecordSaveChangedKeys,
and we have CKRecordSaveAllKeys.

358
00:16:34.236 --> 00:16:37.186 A:middle
So, let's look at the
differences between those.

359
00:16:38.236 --> 00:16:42.336 A:middle
The biggest difference is
what they determine for a,

360
00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:43.866 A:middle
what I'm going to
call a locked save.

361
00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:46.856 A:middle
And a locked save is
a way of making sure

362
00:16:46.856 --> 00:16:48.646 A:middle
that you don't overwrite
data on the server

363
00:16:48.646 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
that someone else
has already written.

364
00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:52.156 A:middle
When you perform a locked save,

365
00:16:52.156 --> 00:16:56.576 A:middle
it says that if the record has
changed since-on the server

366
00:16:56.576 --> 00:16:57.736 A:middle
since the time you fetched it,

367
00:16:58.206 --> 00:17:00.336 A:middle
the server will give you an
error saying your record is

368
00:17:00.336 --> 00:17:03.466 A:middle
out of date, you need to resolve
this conflict and try again.

369
00:17:04.596 --> 00:17:09.816 A:middle
So, the only thing that performs
a locked save here is CKRecord

370
00:17:09.816 --> 00:17:12.086 A:middle
save policy
SaveIfServerUnchanged.

371
00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:16.076 A:middle
The other two actually force
these changes to the server.

372
00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:17.336 A:middle
So, SaveChangedKeys

373
00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:20.386 A:middle
and SaveAllKeys always overwrite
the values on the server.

374
00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:25.626 A:middle
These policies also determine
how much data we're sending

375
00:17:25.626 --> 00:17:26.106 A:middle
to the server.

376
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.756 A:middle
In the case of
SaveIfServerUnchanged

377
00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:34.286 A:middle
and SaveChangedKeys, we're only
going to send up the, sorry,

378
00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.626 A:middle
we're only going to
send up the values

379
00:17:35.626 --> 00:17:37.466 A:middle
on the record that have changed.

380
00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:39.386 A:middle
In the case of SaveAllKeys,

381
00:17:39.386 --> 00:17:41.686 A:middle
we're going to send the
entire record, all the values,

382
00:17:41.746 --> 00:17:43.726 A:middle
whether you've changed
them or not.

383
00:17:45.216 --> 00:17:48.486 A:middle
So, back to locked updates.

384
00:17:48.486 --> 00:17:50.676 A:middle
We've got this thing
called locking,

385
00:17:50.676 --> 00:17:53.526 A:middle
and if you don't use it,
here's what could go wrong

386
00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:54.526 A:middle
with an unlocked update.

387
00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:57.026 A:middle
Right now, we've got
this contact card.

388
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.456 A:middle
We've got the same name,
first name, last name,

389
00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:02.496 A:middle
picture on two clients,
and in iCloud.

390
00:18:02.496 --> 00:18:03.626 A:middle
Everything is good right now.

391
00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:07.466 A:middle
But let's say the iPhone
changes that contact completely.

392
00:18:07.466 --> 00:18:10.136 A:middle
So it modifies the picture,
it modifies the first name,

393
00:18:10.136 --> 00:18:11.476 A:middle
and it modifies the last name.

394
00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:15.296 A:middle
Well, it's going to perform a
SaveChangedKeys to the server,

395
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:17.806 A:middle
which is going to send up
the things that have changed,

396
00:18:18.156 --> 00:18:20.286 A:middle
and that's going to overwrite
whatever is on the server.

397
00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:25.536 A:middle
Next, before the Mac gets a
chance to download that record,

398
00:18:25.536 --> 00:18:26.896 A:middle
the user edited the first name

399
00:18:26.896 --> 00:18:28.466 A:middle
of that record and
just changed it.

400
00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:33.456 A:middle
And that Mac then sends- does a
SaveChangedKeys with the server,

401
00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:36.496 A:middle
and it sent up just the
property that was modified.

402
00:18:37.176 --> 00:18:40.556 A:middle
And now, we've got a problem
here, oops, we've got a problem.

403
00:18:40.556 --> 00:18:44.206 A:middle
This contact record isn't
what either the clients meant

404
00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:45.036 A:middle
to have.

405
00:18:45.866 --> 00:18:49.096 A:middle
So, to work around this,
we have locked updates.

406
00:18:49.736 --> 00:18:52.346 A:middle
And locked updates are
a way of making sure

407
00:18:52.346 --> 00:18:55.376 A:middle
that the server knows that
you're updating the same values

408
00:18:55.446 --> 00:18:56.536 A:middle
that are already on the server.

409
00:18:57.376 --> 00:18:58.836 A:middle
And we do this with
a change tag.

410
00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:01.606 A:middle
So, the change tag is a
property on the record

411
00:19:02.286 --> 00:19:05.976 A:middle
that necessarily changes anytime
a value in the record changes.

412
00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:09.416 A:middle
In this case, we've got change
tag A both on the server

413
00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:12.926 A:middle
and locally, and so we know that
they both have the same values.

414
00:19:13.796 --> 00:19:17.396 A:middle
If we go and we add a new
property on the local record,

415
00:19:18.296 --> 00:19:21.256 A:middle
when we save that to the server
using the default save policy,

416
00:19:21.366 --> 00:19:23.356 A:middle
it's going to send up
both the change tag

417
00:19:23.946 --> 00:19:25.476 A:middle
and the property that changed.

418
00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:29.096 A:middle
The servers then,
before it does anything,

419
00:19:29.096 --> 00:19:30.756 A:middle
it's going to check
the two change tags,

420
00:19:31.216 --> 00:19:34.296 A:middle
and if they're equal, it'll
apply the change that you made.

421
00:19:34.996 --> 00:19:40.096 A:middle
If on the other hand we have
another client that, oh, sorry,

422
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.056 A:middle
and then the server is going
to send back a new change tag

423
00:19:43.086 --> 00:19:44.586 A:middle
because we did change
a property.

424
00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:49.386 A:middle
We return this new record to
you with the updated change tag

425
00:19:49.386 --> 00:19:50.576 A:middle
in the completion block.

426
00:19:50.576 --> 00:19:53.716 A:middle
So, if you take the record that
we gave you at the end of a save

427
00:19:54.286 --> 00:19:56.836 A:middle
and you do all your subsequent
modifications on that,

428
00:19:57.316 --> 00:19:59.136 A:middle
you'll be using the
updated change token,

429
00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.586 A:middle
and you shouldn't have any
conflicts with the server.

430
00:20:03.716 --> 00:20:05.656 A:middle
Now, let's say we had
another client that, you know,

431
00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:07.896 A:middle
hadn't seen that change and
he was still at version A.

432
00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:10.506 A:middle
And he decides to add
a different property

433
00:20:10.506 --> 00:20:11.036 A:middle
on the record.

434
00:20:11.766 --> 00:20:13.996 A:middle
Well, he's going to save it to
the server, he's going to send

435
00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:16.716 A:middle
up the change tag and
the modified property,

436
00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.476 A:middle
and the server is going
to realize that, hey,

437
00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:20.836 A:middle
those two values
aren't the same.

438
00:20:21.626 --> 00:20:24.266 A:middle
And the client is going to
get back an error saying,

439
00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:25.286 A:middle
you know, you have a conflict.

440
00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:28.146 A:middle
So, how do we handle
these conflicts?

441
00:20:29.876 --> 00:20:32.976 A:middle
Well, if you run into this
case of a locked save failing,

442
00:20:33.456 --> 00:20:36.616 A:middle
you're going to get an error
that CKErrorServerRecordChanged.

443
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.726 A:middle
And because you guys all
went to the introductory talk

444
00:20:39.726 --> 00:20:42.206 A:middle
and you learned about how
great error handling is

445
00:20:42.206 --> 00:20:43.076 A:middle
and how important it is,

446
00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:46.226 A:middle
you've got some fantastic error
handling here, and it's going

447
00:20:46.226 --> 00:20:48.676 A:middle
to check for
CKErrorServerRecordChanged.

448
00:20:49.946 --> 00:20:52.656 A:middle
When you see that, you know that
you're out of date, you're going

449
00:20:52.656 --> 00:20:54.236 A:middle
to need to get the new
record from the server.

450
00:20:54.506 --> 00:20:56.296 A:middle
You're going to need to
take your local changes,

451
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:58.506 A:middle
apply them to that record
and try to save again.

452
00:20:59.566 --> 00:21:01.066 A:middle
And we've already
anticipated that.

453
00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:03.596 A:middle
So, what we're going to do
is help you out a little bit,

454
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.366 A:middle
and we're going to return
those records to you already

455
00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:09.386 A:middle
because we know that's the
next logical thing to do.

456
00:21:10.096 --> 00:21:12.686 A:middle
So, inside of the userInfo
dictionary of this error,

457
00:21:12.806 --> 00:21:14.526 A:middle
you're going to find three
copies of the record.

458
00:21:15.826 --> 00:21:18.176 A:middle
You're going to find the record
that you attempted to save

459
00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:20.866 A:middle
to the server, the one
that encountered the error.

460
00:21:22.116 --> 00:21:23.536 A:middle
You're going to find
the original copy

461
00:21:23.536 --> 00:21:26.736 A:middle
of the local record, which
is the copy we downloaded

462
00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:28.696 A:middle
from the server before
you made any changes.

463
00:21:29.816 --> 00:21:32.126 A:middle
And finally, we're going to
give you the server record back.

464
00:21:32.276 --> 00:21:34.006 A:middle
This is the copy of the
record with the most

465
00:21:34.006 --> 00:21:36.906 A:middle
up to date change tag.

466
00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:40.216 A:middle
You're going to want to figure
out what makes sense out of all

467
00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.196 A:middle
of those copies of
values and keys.

468
00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:44.746 A:middle
You're going to apply them
all to the server version

469
00:21:44.746 --> 00:21:50.326 A:middle
of the record, and then you're
going to retry that save.

470
00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:52.186 A:middle
So, you might be wondering
at this point, you know,

471
00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:55.006 A:middle
what type of save
policy should you use?

472
00:21:55.476 --> 00:21:57.286 A:middle
And the simple answer to that is

473
00:21:57.286 --> 00:22:00.846 A:middle
that you should just always
use CKRecordSaveIfUnchanged,

474
00:22:01.436 --> 00:22:02.686 A:middle
and it's the default.

475
00:22:02.686 --> 00:22:03.936 A:middle
It's the default for a reason,

476
00:22:04.006 --> 00:22:05.896 A:middle
and that's because
it's the safest.

477
00:22:06.086 --> 00:22:08.816 A:middle
If you remember that example
of an unlocked update gone bad,

478
00:22:09.486 --> 00:22:11.676 A:middle
you could end up with really
mixed-up, corrupt data

479
00:22:11.676 --> 00:22:13.626 A:middle
on the server if you're
not using locking.

480
00:22:15.196 --> 00:22:17.446 A:middle
However, there is
always a time and place

481
00:22:17.446 --> 00:22:19.226 A:middle
for using unlocked updates.

482
00:22:19.816 --> 00:22:23.226 A:middle
And the biggest case for these
are highly contentious updates.

483
00:22:23.746 --> 00:22:25.676 A:middle
If you're doing anything
in the public database,

484
00:22:25.676 --> 00:22:27.886 A:middle
you might have hundreds
or thousands or millions

485
00:22:27.886 --> 00:22:29.866 A:middle
of clients accessing
it at the same time.

486
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:33.706 A:middle
And if every one of those
clients is trying to save if,

487
00:22:34.226 --> 00:22:36.706 A:middle
save the same record and
you're locking on that,

488
00:22:37.616 --> 00:22:39.696 A:middle
most of those clients are going
to be hitting locking errors,

489
00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:41.676 A:middle
they're going to hit
conflicts, and they're going

490
00:22:41.676 --> 00:22:43.116 A:middle
to be retrying really
frequently.

491
00:22:43.976 --> 00:22:46.456 A:middle
So, if you know this is going to
be a really contentious update,

492
00:22:46.996 --> 00:22:50.096 A:middle
you can structure your client
to do unlocked updates as long

493
00:22:50.096 --> 00:22:52.496 A:middle
as you know you're always
writing consistent properties.

494
00:22:53.286 --> 00:22:55.636 A:middle
On the case of that unlocked
update that failed, you know,

495
00:22:55.636 --> 00:22:57.786 A:middle
you could make sure you
always write both the first

496
00:22:57.786 --> 00:23:00.196 A:middle
and last name, and you
know it'll be consistent.

497
00:23:02.176 --> 00:23:05.956 A:middle
The other reason to use an
unlocked update in the case

498
00:23:06.056 --> 00:23:07.666 A:middle
of SaveAllKeys would
be if you want

499
00:23:07.696 --> 00:23:08.976 A:middle
to force something
to the server.

500
00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:11.816 A:middle
The client might say, you know,
the copy on the server is bad,

501
00:23:11.816 --> 00:23:13.716 A:middle
but I know I have a good
copy of the record here.

502
00:23:14.296 --> 00:23:18.376 A:middle
I want to just force that all
on top of the server's copy.

503
00:23:19.836 --> 00:23:23.566 A:middle
There are some catches
to using SaveAllKeys,

504
00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:27.846 A:middle
and one of the problems is
that any property on the server

505
00:23:28.406 --> 00:23:30.846 A:middle
that doesn't exist in the
local record that you're trying

506
00:23:30.846 --> 00:23:32.276 A:middle
to save isn't going

507
00:23:32.276 --> 00:23:36.116 A:middle
to get removed unless
you explicitly remove

508
00:23:36.116 --> 00:23:37.676 A:middle
that property on the record.

509
00:23:38.496 --> 00:23:41.536 A:middle
All those words are
really confusing,

510
00:23:41.616 --> 00:23:43.006 A:middle
and it's really hard to explain.

511
00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:44.346 A:middle
So instead, I'm going
to try and explain

512
00:23:44.346 --> 00:23:45.266 A:middle
that with the picture here.

513
00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:48.346 A:middle
So, we've got our
contact record again.

514
00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:51.086 A:middle
What we're going to do is
add a couple of properties.

515
00:23:51.086 --> 00:23:52.386 A:middle
We're going to change
the first name,

516
00:23:52.386 --> 00:23:53.556 A:middle
we're going to add
a new property,

517
00:23:54.006 --> 00:23:55.346 A:middle
and we're going to
delete the hobby.

518
00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:59.756 A:middle
We're now going to do a
SaveAllKeys to the server.

519
00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:04.316 A:middle
What that's going to do is send
up all of these properties,

520
00:24:04.846 --> 00:24:07.986 A:middle
even the ones we didn't change
locally, and they're going

521
00:24:07.986 --> 00:24:09.516 A:middle
to update the values
on the server.

522
00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:12.026 A:middle
But what you'll notice here is

523
00:24:12.026 --> 00:24:14.016 A:middle
that the server had
an additional property

524
00:24:14.016 --> 00:24:17.446 A:middle
that we didn't have in our
original copy of the record.

525
00:24:17.446 --> 00:24:19.406 A:middle
This hometown property
wasn't removed.

526
00:24:20.736 --> 00:24:23.756 A:middle
We do this to help you with
versioning of your app.

527
00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:28.156 A:middle
You might release a version 2
of your app that adds hometowns

528
00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:30.386 A:middle
but version 1 didn't ever
know about the hometown.

529
00:24:30.926 --> 00:24:33.506 A:middle
And if version 1 was
using SaveAllKeys,

530
00:24:33.926 --> 00:24:35.966 A:middle
it's going to overwrite these
properties on the server

531
00:24:35.966 --> 00:24:38.766 A:middle
that it never knew about, and
that's kind of a bad thing.

532
00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:42.086 A:middle
You can't have backwards
compatible code easily that way.

533
00:24:43.386 --> 00:24:46.406 A:middle
So, what we do instead is we
still allow you to remove that,

534
00:24:46.496 --> 00:24:48.936 A:middle
but you need to explicitly
tell us that you want

535
00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:50.416 A:middle
that property deleted
on the server.

536
00:24:51.216 --> 00:24:53.376 A:middle
So, even though there's
no hometown property

537
00:24:53.376 --> 00:24:57.696 A:middle
on this record, we can still
call CKRecordSetValueForKey nil

538
00:24:58.066 --> 00:25:00.246 A:middle
or we can call
removeObjectForKey.

539
00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:02.466 A:middle
We're going to remove
the hometown,

540
00:25:02.466 --> 00:25:04.246 A:middle
and now when we save
it up to the server,

541
00:25:04.526 --> 00:25:08.996 A:middle
that delete will also
go up with the save.

542
00:25:09.146 --> 00:25:12.646 A:middle
Finally, one of the really
neat things about CKRecord is

543
00:25:12.646 --> 00:25:14.346 A:middle
that we allow you to
have partial records.

544
00:25:15.126 --> 00:25:17.736 A:middle
So, you might have a really
big record on the server,

545
00:25:17.736 --> 00:25:20.056 A:middle
and you only care about one
or two properties of that.

546
00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:23.346 A:middle
Well, with the desiredKeys
property, we allow you

547
00:25:23.346 --> 00:25:26.306 A:middle
to fetch just a certain
subset of the properties

548
00:25:26.306 --> 00:25:27.216 A:middle
that are on the server.

549
00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:32.406 A:middle
And we expose this desiredKeys
property on any operation

550
00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:34.116 A:middle
that fetches a record,
so you're going to see it

551
00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:37.956 A:middle
on CKFetchRecordsOperation,
CKQueryOperation,

552
00:25:37.956 --> 00:25:40.476 A:middle
and
CKFetchRecordChangesOperation.

553
00:25:42.146 --> 00:25:43.346 A:middle
And the really neat thing

554
00:25:43.346 --> 00:25:46.006 A:middle
about this is you can then
take these partial records

555
00:25:46.006 --> 00:25:47.636 A:middle
and save them back
up to the server.

556
00:25:47.716 --> 00:25:50.316 A:middle
You don't need to work
with entirely full records.

557
00:25:50.856 --> 00:25:53.096 A:middle
You can, you know, if you
want to update just one value

558
00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:55.676 A:middle
on a record, fetch that
one value from the record,

559
00:25:55.796 --> 00:25:58.206 A:middle
update it, and do a
save of just that record

560
00:25:58.206 --> 00:25:59.186 A:middle
that has that one value.

561
00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:01.956 A:middle
If you're doing this
with locking enabled,

562
00:26:02.306 --> 00:26:05.266 A:middle
you know it's safe because
if the record is changed

563
00:26:05.266 --> 00:26:13.216 A:middle
on the server since then,
you're going to get a conflict.

564
00:26:13.436 --> 00:26:14.736 A:middle
So now, let's talk a little bit

565
00:26:14.736 --> 00:26:16.626 A:middle
about modeling your
data for CloudKit.

566
00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:20.446 A:middle
If we go back to that
example of a Receipts app,

567
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:23.926 A:middle
let's say we have a shoebox
that holds all our receipts

568
00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:27.126 A:middle
and that's going to be
one object in the cloud,

569
00:26:27.596 --> 00:26:28.766 A:middle
and we're going to
have an object

570
00:26:28.766 --> 00:26:29.946 A:middle
for each one of our receipts.

571
00:26:31.036 --> 00:26:34.586 A:middle
And the initial way you might
design this is you create a

572
00:26:34.586 --> 00:26:36.456 A:middle
receipts array inside
of your shoebox,

573
00:26:37.156 --> 00:26:39.596 A:middle
and every time you add a
new receipt, you're going

574
00:26:39.596 --> 00:26:42.576 A:middle
to add new entry to that
array and that entry is going

575
00:26:42.576 --> 00:26:44.626 A:middle
to be a reference to the
record you just created.

576
00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:47.136 A:middle
We call these forward
references.

577
00:26:47.136 --> 00:26:49.636 A:middle
These are references from
a parent to its child.

578
00:26:50.666 --> 00:26:52.086 A:middle
And the problem with
these is that you end

579
00:26:52.086 --> 00:26:54.046 A:middle
up getting bottlenecked
on that receipts array.

580
00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:57.746 A:middle
If this was a public database,
you might have hundreds

581
00:26:57.746 --> 00:26:59.606 A:middle
of clients trying to
save this record at once.

582
00:27:00.386 --> 00:27:03.166 A:middle
And every time a client
tries to add a new record,

583
00:27:03.866 --> 00:27:06.616 A:middle
they need to update that
array on the shoebox,

584
00:27:06.816 --> 00:27:08.976 A:middle
and even though the clients
might be adding different

585
00:27:08.976 --> 00:27:13.216 A:middle
records, different receipts,
they're all going to run

586
00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:16.376 A:middle
into conflicts on the shoebox
app, or on the shoebox record.

587
00:27:17.146 --> 00:27:20.106 A:middle
So, we recommend that you try
and avoid forward references

588
00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:24.496 A:middle
in your design, and instead, use
what we call back references.

589
00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:26.886 A:middle
So, instead of having
the shoebox point

590
00:27:26.886 --> 00:27:29.736 A:middle
at the receipt that's in
it, have the receipt point

591
00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:30.906 A:middle
at the shoebox that it's in.

592
00:27:32.506 --> 00:27:35.566 A:middle
The great thing about this
is it's very scalable.

593
00:27:35.566 --> 00:27:39.376 A:middle
You can have millions of clients
adding receipts all at once,

594
00:27:39.476 --> 00:27:40.586 A:middle
and there's no bottleneck.

595
00:27:40.586 --> 00:27:42.956 A:middle
They can create their receipt,
point at who owns them,

596
00:27:43.596 --> 00:27:47.296 A:middle
and none of them are going
to run into conflicts.

597
00:27:47.296 --> 00:27:49.476 A:middle
When you need to go get
everything that's in a shoebox,

598
00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:51.706 A:middle
rather than fetching that
shoebox, getting the array

599
00:27:51.706 --> 00:27:54.186 A:middle
of records in it, and
fetching all those records,

600
00:27:54.646 --> 00:27:56.186 A:middle
you can instead just
use a query.

601
00:27:56.976 --> 00:27:59.636 A:middle
That query is going to select
all of the records that have

602
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:04.446 A:middle
that shoebox as an owner.

603
00:28:04.446 --> 00:28:05.696 A:middle
One other neat feature
we give you

604
00:28:05.696 --> 00:28:08.416 A:middle
with the relationships
are cascading deletes.

605
00:28:09.116 --> 00:28:10.866 A:middle
So, cascading deletes
are a way for you

606
00:28:10.866 --> 00:28:14.656 A:middle
to make your object graph
get cleaned up automatically,

607
00:28:15.356 --> 00:28:17.556 A:middle
and you do this by
marking your references

608
00:28:17.596 --> 00:28:20.356 A:middle
with a
CKReferenceActionDeleteSelf,

609
00:28:21.036 --> 00:28:23.636 A:middle
and that means that
when the record

610
00:28:23.636 --> 00:28:26.586 A:middle
that you referenced is deleted,
you will also be deleted.

611
00:28:26.826 --> 00:28:28.616 A:middle
In this case, the
green record has

612
00:28:28.676 --> 00:28:30.946 A:middle
that reference action
pointed in the orange record.

613
00:28:31.646 --> 00:28:32.976 A:middle
When the orange record
gets deleted,

614
00:28:33.476 --> 00:28:34.356 A:middle
the green record is going

615
00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:36.266 A:middle
to get automatically
deleted by the server.

616
00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:39.836 A:middle
These deletes also cascade.

617
00:28:39.976 --> 00:28:42.556 A:middle
So, if we had a whole
tree of objects hang off

618
00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:45.236 A:middle
of that one orange record,
those deletes are going

619
00:28:45.236 --> 00:28:49.806 A:middle
to cascade all the way down
and clean up our graph for us.

620
00:28:54.496 --> 00:28:56.076 A:middle
But one thing to keep in mind

621
00:28:56.076 --> 00:28:57.986 A:middle
with these delete
self references is

622
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.216 A:middle
that they're not
reference counted.

623
00:29:00.216 --> 00:29:03.606 A:middle
That means that if you have
multiple references coming

624
00:29:03.606 --> 00:29:05.666 A:middle
out of one record, the first one

625
00:29:05.666 --> 00:29:12.076 A:middle
of those records that's deleted
will cause you to get deleted.

626
00:29:12.166 --> 00:29:16.436 A:middle
And finally, these delete
self references give you one

627
00:29:16.436 --> 00:29:17.256 A:middle
additional feature.

628
00:29:17.526 --> 00:29:20.866 A:middle
If you're doing a batch save and
you've got a jumble of records

629
00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:23.666 A:middle
in this graph, and they
have delete self references

630
00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:25.316 A:middle
between them, CloudKit is going

631
00:29:25.316 --> 00:29:27.906 A:middle
to do an automatic
topological sort for you.

632
00:29:27.906 --> 00:29:30.586 A:middle
We're going to upload
the records in order

633
00:29:30.586 --> 00:29:33.146 A:middle
so that all the records that
are referenced will be up there

634
00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:35.586 A:middle
by the time the record
reference in them is uploaded.

635
00:29:36.076 --> 00:29:38.196 A:middle
This is really great
in the public database

636
00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:41.606 A:middle
where you don't have atomic
commits but you still want

637
00:29:41.606 --> 00:29:44.636 A:middle
to be able to upload data that
looks consistent at any point

638
00:29:44.636 --> 00:29:46.326 A:middle
when a client downloads it.

639
00:29:48.846 --> 00:29:51.956 A:middle
So, while developing CloudKit
internally, we've had a couple

640
00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:54.016 A:middle
of our clients ask us,
you know, why do I need

641
00:29:54.016 --> 00:29:55.346 A:middle
to use these reference objects?

642
00:29:55.346 --> 00:29:58.306 A:middle
I have to, you know, alloc and
omit and it's so much work.

643
00:29:58.306 --> 00:30:01.646 A:middle
You know, I've got a record
ID, why can't I just put it

644
00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:02.976 A:middle
in the string and put
that in my record?

645
00:30:03.696 --> 00:30:04.896 A:middle
You can, so, you know, you come

646
00:30:04.896 --> 00:30:06.806 A:middle
up with this clever
little RecordIDToString,

647
00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:09.196 A:middle
but then you look at
the recordID class

648
00:30:09.196 --> 00:30:11.696 A:middle
and you realize it's
actually two properties,

649
00:30:11.696 --> 00:30:14.426 A:middle
and you can't just store the
description of the record

650
00:30:14.426 --> 00:30:16.966 A:middle
on the server so you
get a little smarter

651
00:30:16.966 --> 00:30:21.346 A:middle
and you store the recordID
and the name and the zoneID.

652
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:25.686 A:middle
But then, you look at zoneID
and that's also composite.

653
00:30:26.426 --> 00:30:30.676 A:middle
We need to know what, where
zone is and whose account it is.

654
00:30:31.256 --> 00:30:32.986 A:middle
So, you get a little more clever

655
00:30:32.986 --> 00:30:34.976 A:middle
and you make this
RecordIDToString

656
00:30:34.976 --> 00:30:39.066 A:middle
and ZoneIDToString, and now
you call that everywhere.

657
00:30:39.226 --> 00:30:41.936 A:middle
The problem is now you're
not forwards compatible.

658
00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:45.346 A:middle
If anything ever gets added to
references, all of your records

659
00:30:45.346 --> 00:30:47.856 A:middle
on the server are already going
to have this hard coded format,

660
00:30:48.256 --> 00:30:49.996 A:middle
and you're going to have
to go through a lot of work

661
00:30:49.996 --> 00:30:51.156 A:middle
when you query records.

662
00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:54.726 A:middle
Instead, just use references.

663
00:30:54.726 --> 00:30:56.166 A:middle
It's going to make
your code really clean.

664
00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:58.356 A:middle
I mean that shoebox
could be a recordID,

665
00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:01.106 A:middle
that shoebox could be a record
itself, it could be a reference.

666
00:31:01.566 --> 00:31:04.046 A:middle
All of those will just work as
long as you use the CKReference.

667
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:10.556 A:middle
A couple last notes on
modeling your data in CloudKit.

668
00:31:11.896 --> 00:31:14.866 A:middle
One of them is that CloudKit
is a transport mechanism.

669
00:31:14.986 --> 00:31:17.776 A:middle
What we've tried to do here
is give you an easy way

670
00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:21.446 A:middle
to access the CloudKit
servers, but we're not meant

671
00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:23.296 A:middle
to be a local persistence layer.

672
00:31:23.296 --> 00:31:26.516 A:middle
We want that to be up to
you, and you need to figure

673
00:31:26.516 --> 00:31:28.096 A:middle
out the best way to
store your objects.

674
00:31:28.746 --> 00:31:33.336 A:middle
And to that extent, we recommend
that you don't subclass CKItems.

675
00:31:33.526 --> 00:31:36.516 A:middle
You should take those items when
you receive them from the server

676
00:31:37.216 --> 00:31:40.896 A:middle
and translate them into your own
model objects, and you can do

677
00:31:40.896 --> 00:31:42.046 A:middle
that on the way out as well.

678
00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:44.606 A:middle
When you need to save one of
your model objects, translate it

679
00:31:44.606 --> 00:31:55.036 A:middle
into a CKRecord and upload
all of that to the server.

680
00:31:55.216 --> 00:31:57.136 A:middle
So, if you remember from
the introductory talk,

681
00:31:57.136 --> 00:31:59.466 A:middle
we have these things that
we call subscriptions.

682
00:31:59.596 --> 00:32:01.686 A:middle
They're persistent queries
that run on the server,

683
00:32:02.536 --> 00:32:05.396 A:middle
and every time something
changes that matches that query,

684
00:32:06.186 --> 00:32:07.616 A:middle
you're going to get
a push notification.

685
00:32:08.546 --> 00:32:11.206 A:middle
And these push notifications
are sent via the Apple Push

686
00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:14.026 A:middle
Notification Service, just the
same way that it would work

687
00:32:14.026 --> 00:32:15.106 A:middle
if you built your own server.

688
00:32:16.766 --> 00:32:18.356 A:middle
But there are some drawbacks

689
00:32:18.356 --> 00:32:20.336 A:middle
with Apple Push Notification
Service.

690
00:32:20.336 --> 00:32:22.966 A:middle
One of them is that they
can't make any guarantees

691
00:32:22.966 --> 00:32:24.366 A:middle
on delivery of these pushes.

692
00:32:24.446 --> 00:32:26.536 A:middle
They're kind of meant to
be these ephemeral, little,

693
00:32:26.536 --> 00:32:28.086 A:middle
you know, here's a
push, here's a push.

694
00:32:28.586 --> 00:32:31.096 A:middle
If one of them gets dropped
because of a bad network

695
00:32:31.096 --> 00:32:35.306 A:middle
or anything else going
on, there's no guarantee.

696
00:32:35.636 --> 00:32:37.316 A:middle
So, in practice,
they're really good

697
00:32:37.316 --> 00:32:38.536 A:middle
about delivering these pushes.

698
00:32:39.006 --> 00:32:40.606 A:middle
And one of the reasons is

699
00:32:40.656 --> 00:32:42.346 A:middle
because the server
will store pushes

700
00:32:42.346 --> 00:32:43.596 A:middle
for you if you're offline.

701
00:32:44.246 --> 00:32:45.936 A:middle
So, if you put your
phone in Airplane Mode

702
00:32:45.936 --> 00:32:48.216 A:middle
and you get a push, as
soon as you come back

703
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:50.366 A:middle
out of Airplane Mode, the
server will have that saved

704
00:32:50.366 --> 00:32:51.806 A:middle
and still deliver
the push on to you.

705
00:32:52.976 --> 00:32:56.226 A:middle
But the problem with this is
the server only stores one push

706
00:32:56.296 --> 00:32:56.796 A:middle
per client.

707
00:32:57.776 --> 00:33:00.376 A:middle
So, if you received a bunch of
pushes while you're offline,

708
00:33:00.376 --> 00:33:02.086 A:middle
you're only going to
get the most recent one.

709
00:33:03.676 --> 00:33:04.416 A:middle
What does that look like?

710
00:33:04.456 --> 00:33:07.026 A:middle
Well, we've got our
CloudKit server,

711
00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:09.866 A:middle
we've got the APS server, and
we've got the iPhone up here.

712
00:33:10.366 --> 00:33:13.486 A:middle
And we send a push, and we're
online, everything goes through,

713
00:33:13.486 --> 00:33:15.036 A:middle
we get our badge,
everyone's happy.

714
00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:18.196 A:middle
But then, we get on an airplane.

715
00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:21.126 A:middle
Our phone is in Airplane Mode;
we have no network connection.

716
00:33:22.136 --> 00:33:24.176 A:middle
And when that push gets sent,

717
00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:26.176 A:middle
the APS server helpfully
stores it for us.

718
00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:28.126 A:middle
If we were going to come
back online right now,

719
00:33:28.126 --> 00:33:30.636 A:middle
we would get our subscription
push and we'd be happy.

720
00:33:31.626 --> 00:33:34.596 A:middle
But this is a long plane flight
and while we're on the plane,

721
00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:37.696 A:middle
we got a zone update push,
that new zone subscription

722
00:33:37.696 --> 00:33:38.546 A:middle
that I was talking about.

723
00:33:39.556 --> 00:33:42.916 A:middle
When that gets to the APS
server, it's going to drop

724
00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:44.416 A:middle
that previous subscription push,

725
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:48.296 A:middle
and now when your phone comes
back online, all you're going

726
00:33:48.296 --> 00:33:49.566 A:middle
to receive is the zone update.

727
00:33:51.096 --> 00:33:52.736 A:middle
The problem with this
is that you never heard

728
00:33:52.736 --> 00:33:54.096 A:middle
about that subscription
that fired.

729
00:33:54.806 --> 00:33:56.016 A:middle
So, how do we solve this?

730
00:33:56.016 --> 00:33:59.356 A:middle
Well, we've created a
notification collection

731
00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:00.006 A:middle
in CloudKit.

732
00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:04.376 A:middle
Every time the server sends
a push to the APS server,

733
00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:06.616 A:middle
it also makes a copy
of that push

734
00:34:06.616 --> 00:34:07.936 A:middle
in the notification collection.

735
00:34:08.896 --> 00:34:11.356 A:middle
So, you can see we have that
same problem where we're

736
00:34:11.356 --> 00:34:13.686 A:middle
in Airplane Mode, we dropped
our subscription push,

737
00:34:14.446 --> 00:34:16.346 A:middle
our phone comes online,
and it gets the push,

738
00:34:17.416 --> 00:34:19.406 A:middle
and because this is a
well-behaved client,

739
00:34:19.406 --> 00:34:21.485 A:middle
it knows every time
it receives a push,

740
00:34:21.545 --> 00:34:23.726 A:middle
it should go check the
notification collection to find

741
00:34:23.726 --> 00:34:25.846 A:middle
out about anything
it might have missed.

742
00:34:26.896 --> 00:34:28.116 A:middle
So, how does that work?

743
00:34:28.116 --> 00:34:30.786 A:middle
Well, this notification
collection is a lot

744
00:34:30.786 --> 00:34:32.686 A:middle
like the delta downloads
I talked about earlier.

745
00:34:33.275 --> 00:34:34.676 A:middle
It's all change token-based.

746
00:34:35.126 --> 00:34:36.656 A:middle
You hand a change
token to the server,

747
00:34:37.005 --> 00:34:39.116 A:middle
and the server hands back
all the notifications

748
00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:41.016 A:middle
that have changed
since then along

749
00:34:41.016 --> 00:34:42.255 A:middle
with an updated change token.

750
00:34:42.826 --> 00:34:45.716 A:middle
So, since this is our
first time talking

751
00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.366 A:middle
to the notification
collection, we're going to send

752
00:34:47.366 --> 00:34:48.456 A:middle
up a nil change token.

753
00:34:49.576 --> 00:34:51.676 A:middle
We're going to get back
both of those pushes,

754
00:34:51.676 --> 00:34:53.045 A:middle
one of them which we missed.

755
00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:57.005 A:middle
And then we're also going to
get an updated change token

756
00:34:57.005 --> 00:34:59.566 A:middle
for the current state.

757
00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:04.396 A:middle
One thing with subscriptions is
that you might want to use those

758
00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:06.516 A:middle
to change some UI
in your application.

759
00:35:07.056 --> 00:35:10.946 A:middle
For example in our Receipts app,
we might want a subscription

760
00:35:11.006 --> 00:35:14.176 A:middle
for any receipt that
was over 100 dollars.

761
00:35:14.176 --> 00:35:16.986 A:middle
If that happens, we want to mark

762
00:35:17.626 --> 00:35:19.256 A:middle
that receipt in a
different color.

763
00:35:19.446 --> 00:35:21.736 A:middle
So we're going to get this
push for a subscription,

764
00:35:22.656 --> 00:35:24.226 A:middle
and now that receipt is blue

765
00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:26.036 A:middle
because it was a big
expensive receipt.

766
00:35:27.396 --> 00:35:30.046 A:middle
But, you know, this is going
to happen on all your clients,

767
00:35:30.046 --> 00:35:32.336 A:middle
so you're going to have you iPad
showing that receipt in blue,

768
00:35:32.336 --> 00:35:34.536 A:middle
you're going to have your Mac
showing that receipt in blue,

769
00:35:35.016 --> 00:35:38.356 A:middle
and once this acknowledges
it, you want that UI state

770
00:35:38.396 --> 00:35:40.776 A:middle
to go away on all your clients.

771
00:35:41.666 --> 00:35:44.476 A:middle
Well, the way we do that is we
let you mark a subscription,

772
00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:46.806 A:middle
sorry, we let you mark
a notification as red.

773
00:35:46.856 --> 00:35:49.366 A:middle
And when you do that,
you're going to get a push

774
00:35:49.366 --> 00:35:51.576 A:middle
for the updated subscription,

775
00:35:51.856 --> 00:35:53.816 A:middle
updated notification
on every client.

776
00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:56.136 A:middle
So, in this case,
we mark our receipt.

777
00:35:56.136 --> 00:35:58.826 A:middle
We're going to go mark
that subscription as red

778
00:35:58.826 --> 00:36:00.846 A:middle
on the server, and now
there's a new entry.

779
00:36:02.406 --> 00:36:04.786 A:middle
And if we switch over to our
Mac which is still showing it

780
00:36:04.786 --> 00:36:06.286 A:middle
in blue, it's going
to get a push,

781
00:36:06.516 --> 00:36:08.356 A:middle
it's going to check the
notification collection,

782
00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:11.856 A:middle
it's going to get that
subscription notification,

783
00:36:12.006 --> 00:36:14.466 A:middle
and it can tear down
its UI and now all

784
00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:16.926 A:middle
of your clients are
in the same state.

785
00:36:19.426 --> 00:36:20.966 A:middle
So, with the notification
collection,

786
00:36:20.966 --> 00:36:22.976 A:middle
keep in mind every
time you get a push,

787
00:36:22.976 --> 00:36:24.826 A:middle
you should check the
notification collection.

788
00:36:25.086 --> 00:36:27.306 A:middle
You never know what
you might have missed.

789
00:36:28.236 --> 00:36:31.366 A:middle
And this isn't just for
Airplane Mode or bad networks.

790
00:36:31.526 --> 00:36:34.946 A:middle
This can happen if you get
multiple pushes in a row.

791
00:36:34.946 --> 00:36:36.836 A:middle
If there's a lot of changes
that happen all at once,

792
00:36:37.376 --> 00:36:39.256 A:middle
the CloudKit server
might coalesce them,

793
00:36:39.256 --> 00:36:43.646 A:middle
or the push server might
coalesce those pushes.

794
00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:46.836 A:middle
And of course, because a lot
of these are mobile devices,

795
00:36:46.836 --> 00:36:48.966 A:middle
they're iPhones, they're
going to be moving in

796
00:36:48.966 --> 00:36:50.056 A:middle
and out of network states.

797
00:36:50.096 --> 00:36:53.786 A:middle
They might be on Wi-Fi, or they
might be on a bad cell network.

798
00:36:53.786 --> 00:36:55.516 A:middle
You never know what
your network is like.

799
00:36:56.356 --> 00:36:58.686 A:middle
Just assume that there
might have been more pushes

800
00:36:58.726 --> 00:37:00.206 A:middle
that you didn't hear about.

801
00:37:04.176 --> 00:37:06.696 A:middle
So, now we're going to go
over the iCloud Dashboard.

802
00:37:07.036 --> 00:37:09.996 A:middle
And the iCloud Dashboard
is our web-based interface

803
00:37:10.076 --> 00:37:13.166 A:middle
for managing your
application in CloudKit.

804
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:17.346 A:middle
The iCloud Dashboard
lets you view your data.

805
00:37:18.076 --> 00:37:20.636 A:middle
It lets you manage the schema
that we're creating for you.

806
00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:25.926 A:middle
It lets you control what's
indexed, and it helps you moving

807
00:37:25.926 --> 00:37:27.136 A:middle
from development to production.

808
00:37:27.136 --> 00:37:29.486 A:middle
I'm going to explain all of
those in detail in a bit.

809
00:37:29.756 --> 00:37:31.526 A:middle
Let's start with viewing data.

810
00:37:33.596 --> 00:37:38.166 A:middle
So, if you remember the view
of our containers up here,

811
00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:40.466 A:middle
we've got a public database
and a private database.

812
00:37:41.556 --> 00:37:44.706 A:middle
And when you're viewing your
data in the iCloud Dashboard,

813
00:37:45.426 --> 00:37:48.506 A:middle
all of that data in the public
database is of course public.

814
00:37:48.936 --> 00:37:52.356 A:middle
So, in the dashboard, you'll
be able to see every record

815
00:37:52.356 --> 00:37:53.536 A:middle
in your public database.

816
00:37:54.996 --> 00:37:58.266 A:middle
But if you remember, the private
database is again one database

817
00:37:58.336 --> 00:37:59.706 A:middle
for each individual user.

818
00:38:00.646 --> 00:38:03.266 A:middle
And in this case, we're
only logged in as one user.

819
00:38:03.266 --> 00:38:04.976 A:middle
We're logged in as
our developer account.

820
00:38:05.826 --> 00:38:09.126 A:middle
So, all we're going to see in
the iCloud Dashboard is the data

821
00:38:09.426 --> 00:38:13.036 A:middle
in the private database
for our developer account.

822
00:38:13.036 --> 00:38:13.966 A:middle
This is really important.

823
00:38:13.966 --> 00:38:16.006 A:middle
You know, you might use a
different account for testing

824
00:38:16.006 --> 00:38:17.586 A:middle
and a different account
for viewing data

825
00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:18.696 A:middle
in the iCloud Dashboard.

826
00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:20.476 A:middle
If you do that, you
won't be able

827
00:38:20.476 --> 00:38:22.696 A:middle
to view your private
data in the dashboard.

828
00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:26.226 A:middle
So, what does the
dashboard look like?

829
00:38:26.266 --> 00:38:29.736 A:middle
Well, we log in, and the
first thing we're going

830
00:38:29.736 --> 00:38:31.856 A:middle
to see here are our
different record types.

831
00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:34.856 A:middle
So, you can see we're
using the Party app.

832
00:38:34.856 --> 00:38:37.226 A:middle
We've got parties,
and over here,

833
00:38:37.226 --> 00:38:39.476 A:middle
we see the different schema

834
00:38:39.576 --> 00:38:41.676 A:middle
for those values
that's been created.

835
00:38:43.426 --> 00:38:45.556 A:middle
When you're developing
a CloudKit application,

836
00:38:45.996 --> 00:38:47.736 A:middle
you're talking at the
development environment,

837
00:38:48.386 --> 00:38:49.286 A:middle
and the server

838
00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:52.166 A:middle
in the development environment
creates a just-in-time schema

839
00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:52.566 A:middle
for you.

840
00:38:53.256 --> 00:38:55.946 A:middle
So, we did this because we
wanted you to be able to develop

841
00:38:55.946 --> 00:38:57.256 A:middle
as rapidly as possible.

842
00:38:57.256 --> 00:39:01.706 A:middle
We didn't want you have to go
to a, this dashboard and plan

843
00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:03.576 A:middle
out what you were going
to do in your application

844
00:39:03.576 --> 00:39:05.066 A:middle
and choose all the data types.

845
00:39:05.066 --> 00:39:07.746 A:middle
That's not as much fun as
just writing some code.

846
00:39:08.016 --> 00:39:10.856 A:middle
So, we let you dive right
in, you write some code,

847
00:39:11.436 --> 00:39:14.726 A:middle
and the things that you upload
to CloudKit as you upload them,

848
00:39:15.146 --> 00:39:17.376 A:middle
those values get
locked in into a schema.

849
00:39:18.526 --> 00:39:20.496 A:middle
So, you can see here
that we've got a couple

850
00:39:20.496 --> 00:39:23.426 A:middle
of different values, and we've
got their, couple different keys

851
00:39:23.426 --> 00:39:26.146 A:middle
and their values but we
notice that we made a mistake

852
00:39:26.146 --> 00:39:27.476 A:middle
when we're developing this app.

853
00:39:27.666 --> 00:39:30.666 A:middle
We uploaded a date
value or a date key,

854
00:39:31.106 --> 00:39:32.276 A:middle
but we use a string value.

855
00:39:32.276 --> 00:39:34.136 A:middle
And what we really want
there is a date value.

856
00:39:34.886 --> 00:39:37.306 A:middle
The iCloud Dashboard is
going to let us fix that up.

857
00:39:37.826 --> 00:39:40.026 A:middle
So we can go to this
and we can delete it.

858
00:39:41.016 --> 00:39:42.386 A:middle
We can remove it
from our schema,

859
00:39:43.336 --> 00:39:46.296 A:middle
and now we can recompile
our app, use a date value,

860
00:39:46.756 --> 00:39:49.696 A:middle
upload that record again,
and when the server sees

861
00:39:49.696 --> 00:39:52.446 A:middle
that record, it will
create a new schema entry

862
00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:59.866 A:middle
for the date value using an
actual date instead of a string.

863
00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:02.306 A:middle
So next up, you can
view all the records

864
00:40:02.306 --> 00:40:05.376 A:middle
in your public database
using the iCloud Dashboard.

865
00:40:05.696 --> 00:40:07.486 A:middle
So, you can see here,
we already have a couple

866
00:40:07.486 --> 00:40:09.496 A:middle
of different parties
in the public database.

867
00:40:10.736 --> 00:40:14.306 A:middle
What you can also do is create
records in the public database.

868
00:40:14.396 --> 00:40:18.356 A:middle
So, you can tap on this Plus
button and fill out a new entry.

869
00:40:19.026 --> 00:40:22.226 A:middle
We're going to make a new
party for coffee on Friday,

870
00:40:23.276 --> 00:40:26.966 A:middle
and we can save that and you'll
see that that actually got saved

871
00:40:27.036 --> 00:40:28.276 A:middle
into the public database.

872
00:40:28.316 --> 00:40:31.256 A:middle
Any clients that are fetching
records are going to see

873
00:40:31.256 --> 00:40:33.316 A:middle
that change in the
public database.

874
00:40:33.876 --> 00:40:37.796 A:middle
We can also search for records.

875
00:40:37.796 --> 00:40:39.136 A:middle
This is just like CKQuery.

876
00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.866 A:middle
So we can click on
that magnifying glass,

877
00:40:42.816 --> 00:40:46.326 A:middle
and we can type any
string, and we can filter

878
00:40:46.326 --> 00:40:49.316 A:middle
down to any party
that mentions WWDC.

879
00:40:50.566 --> 00:40:52.856 A:middle
Additionally, this gives
us all the functionality

880
00:40:52.856 --> 00:40:54.246 A:middle
that we have in CKQuery.

881
00:40:54.246 --> 00:40:56.836 A:middle
We can build compound queries
right in the dashboard.

882
00:40:57.326 --> 00:41:01.516 A:middle
So, if you click on the Plus
button, let's choose location,

883
00:41:01.516 --> 00:41:03.716 A:middle
and let's filter down
to everything that's

884
00:41:03.716 --> 00:41:06.246 A:middle
within 5 kilometers
of Moscone Center.

885
00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:08.016 A:middle
I happen to have
those memorized.

886
00:41:08.636 --> 00:41:12.826 A:middle
So, that filtered everything
down just to the two parties

887
00:41:12.826 --> 00:41:13.726 A:middle
that are in this area.

888
00:41:16.556 --> 00:41:18.766 A:middle
Finally, in the public database,

889
00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:22.336 A:middle
by default every record
can be read by every user,

890
00:41:23.346 --> 00:41:25.426 A:middle
and it can be created
by any user.

891
00:41:25.726 --> 00:41:29.016 A:middle
Once you create a record, that
record can only be updated

892
00:41:29.016 --> 00:41:31.096 A:middle
or deleted by the
user that created it.

893
00:41:32.106 --> 00:41:34.296 A:middle
But we understand that that
doesn't provide all the

894
00:41:34.296 --> 00:41:36.746 A:middle
functionality that you might
need to make an application

895
00:41:36.746 --> 00:41:37.766 A:middle
in the public database.

896
00:41:38.356 --> 00:41:41.186 A:middle
So, what we've given you
are what we call roles.

897
00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:44.106 A:middle
These roles let you
choose sets of users

898
00:41:44.106 --> 00:41:46.606 A:middle
that have different
permissions for record types

899
00:41:46.606 --> 00:41:47.696 A:middle
in the public database.

900
00:41:48.566 --> 00:41:52.156 A:middle
So, one example of that might
be that I want to restrict it

901
00:41:52.156 --> 00:41:55.056 A:middle
so that only I can create
parties in the public database.

902
00:41:55.716 --> 00:41:57.106 A:middle
So, what I'm going
to do in order to do

903
00:41:57.106 --> 00:41:58.556 A:middle
that is create a new role.

904
00:41:58.556 --> 00:42:04.336 A:middle
I'm going to call this, you
know, PartyAdmin, and in that,

905
00:42:04.336 --> 00:42:07.206 A:middle
I need to choose a record type
and give it special permissions.

906
00:42:07.286 --> 00:42:11.676 A:middle
So I'm going to choose parties,
and I'm going to give it Create,

907
00:42:11.676 --> 00:42:13.586 A:middle
Read, and Write permissions
for those parties.

908
00:42:16.466 --> 00:42:19.596 A:middle
Now, what I need to do is go to
the record type and restrict it

909
00:42:19.596 --> 00:42:21.366 A:middle
so that no one else
can create a party.

910
00:42:21.756 --> 00:42:25.586 A:middle
So, I'm going to find my
party, my party record type,

911
00:42:26.106 --> 00:42:29.376 A:middle
and you can see up there
that parties can be created

912
00:42:29.376 --> 00:42:30.666 A:middle
by anyone who's authenticated.

913
00:42:31.226 --> 00:42:33.496 A:middle
We don't want that, we
want only party admins

914
00:42:33.536 --> 00:42:34.416 A:middle
to create this record.

915
00:42:34.506 --> 00:42:38.296 A:middle
So, we're going to
uncheck that value.

916
00:42:38.386 --> 00:42:40.626 A:middle
Now, we need to assign
people to that role

917
00:42:40.696 --> 00:42:42.976 A:middle
so that there's actually users
out there that can do this.

918
00:42:43.796 --> 00:42:45.246 A:middle
If we go to the user records,

919
00:42:45.246 --> 00:42:47.776 A:middle
we can see everyone who's
used this app so far.

920
00:42:48.626 --> 00:42:51.636 A:middle
If they have marked themselves
as discoverable, you're going

921
00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:53.306 A:middle
to be able to see their
first and last name.

922
00:42:53.756 --> 00:42:55.296 A:middle
If they haven't,
you're just going to see

923
00:42:55.296 --> 00:42:57.826 A:middle
that recordID up there.

924
00:42:58.036 --> 00:43:01.396 A:middle
So, I'm going to click on
my user, and then I'm going

925
00:43:01.396 --> 00:43:05.976 A:middle
to add myself as a party admin.

926
00:43:05.976 --> 00:43:08.326 A:middle
And now, I'm the only user
in the public database

927
00:43:08.396 --> 00:43:11.676 A:middle
that can create a party.

928
00:43:13.516 --> 00:43:18.486 A:middle
[ Applause ]

929
00:43:18.986 --> 00:43:22.626 A:middle
So, one of the last things the
iCloud Dashboard helps you do is

930
00:43:22.626 --> 00:43:25.066 A:middle
move from development
into production.

931
00:43:25.376 --> 00:43:27.186 A:middle
So, as I talked about earlier,

932
00:43:27.286 --> 00:43:29.986 A:middle
we wanted the development
environment to be as quick

933
00:43:29.986 --> 00:43:31.556 A:middle
and easy to use as possible.

934
00:43:32.056 --> 00:43:34.076 A:middle
We wanted you to hit the
ground running, we wanted you

935
00:43:34.076 --> 00:43:37.046 A:middle
to just open up Xcode,
start typing some code,

936
00:43:37.046 --> 00:43:39.806 A:middle
save your record to the server,
and see immediate results.

937
00:43:40.496 --> 00:43:43.786 A:middle
And that all works great because
the server does just-in-time

938
00:43:43.786 --> 00:43:47.256 A:middle
schemas, but that's not very
efficient if we're working

939
00:43:47.256 --> 00:43:49.986 A:middle
in a public database that
might have millions of users.

940
00:43:50.066 --> 00:43:52.916 A:middle
We need to prepare some
things before we go

941
00:43:52.916 --> 00:43:55.946 A:middle
into the environment that all of
our customers are going to hit.

942
00:43:56.656 --> 00:43:59.216 A:middle
So, the way this works
is we've got our records,

943
00:43:59.326 --> 00:44:00.696 A:middle
we're developing
our app right now,

944
00:44:01.586 --> 00:44:03.916 A:middle
and we just created a record
for the very first time,

945
00:44:03.916 --> 00:44:05.896 A:middle
and we uploaded it in the
development environment.

946
00:44:07.076 --> 00:44:08.206 A:middle
The server is going to see that

947
00:44:08.256 --> 00:44:10.656 A:middle
and since this is the first
time it's seen a party,

948
00:44:10.656 --> 00:44:13.316 A:middle
it's going to automatically
create a new party record type.

949
00:44:13.316 --> 00:44:16.556 A:middle
And then for each of
these keys and values,

950
00:44:17.056 --> 00:44:19.986 A:middle
it's going to create an entry
in a schema, and it's going

951
00:44:19.986 --> 00:44:22.206 A:middle
to create an index on
every one of those values.

952
00:44:23.316 --> 00:44:26.606 A:middle
This index is what lets you
query for any value in a record.

953
00:44:27.096 --> 00:44:29.656 A:middle
So, while you're in development,
you can just run a query

954
00:44:29.656 --> 00:44:32.506 A:middle
and search on any value
for any key in a record.

955
00:44:33.966 --> 00:44:36.196 A:middle
And let's say we're going ahead
and we're developing this app

956
00:44:36.196 --> 00:44:38.686 A:middle
and we decide we want to
add an additional property,

957
00:44:38.686 --> 00:44:42.116 A:middle
so we decide we want to
have a background property

958
00:44:42.116 --> 00:44:43.356 A:middle
for the color of the party.

959
00:44:43.916 --> 00:44:45.556 A:middle
So, this party's
background is blue.

960
00:44:46.046 --> 00:44:47.556 A:middle
All we have to do is
upload that record.

961
00:44:48.116 --> 00:44:50.566 A:middle
It's going to send all those
other properties to the index,

962
00:44:51.156 --> 00:44:52.936 A:middle
and the server is
going to notice, "Oh,

963
00:44:52.936 --> 00:44:54.056 A:middle
there's a new property in here."

964
00:44:54.546 --> 00:44:57.146 A:middle
It's going to create a new
schema entry, build a new index,

965
00:44:57.536 --> 00:44:58.606 A:middle
and index that property.

966
00:45:00.536 --> 00:45:03.006 A:middle
When you're ready to release
your app, you're going to want

967
00:45:03.006 --> 00:45:05.406 A:middle
to make sure you've run
everything in development first

968
00:45:05.506 --> 00:45:07.466 A:middle
so that you've built up
this just-in-time schema.

969
00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:11.476 A:middle
You're then going to use
the iCloud Dashboard to move

970
00:45:11.476 --> 00:45:13.896 A:middle
that schema from
development into production,

971
00:45:13.896 --> 00:45:15.826 A:middle
and you're going to want to
check all of these fields

972
00:45:15.826 --> 00:45:17.316 A:middle
to make sure that
they're the right values,

973
00:45:17.836 --> 00:45:19.066 A:middle
make sure that every key

974
00:45:19.066 --> 00:45:21.706 A:middle
that your app will ever
use exists in the schema.

975
00:45:22.646 --> 00:45:25.146 A:middle
And when you do that, you're
going to move it into production

976
00:45:25.146 --> 00:45:26.476 A:middle
and lock that schema in.

977
00:45:28.066 --> 00:45:31.406 A:middle
Additionally, all of these
indexes take up a decent amount

978
00:45:31.406 --> 00:45:33.306 A:middle
of space because
it has to make it

979
00:45:33.306 --> 00:45:35.926 A:middle
so that you can query
those records.

980
00:45:35.926 --> 00:45:38.216 A:middle
If you know you're never
going to query a value

981
00:45:38.216 --> 00:45:40.266 A:middle
like we know we're never
going to query for records

982
00:45:40.266 --> 00:45:43.636 A:middle
with just a blue background,
you can drop that index,

983
00:45:43.686 --> 00:45:47.036 A:middle
and this will help free up some
space in your app's database

984
00:45:47.036 --> 00:45:48.746 A:middle
or in your user's database.

985
00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:54.886 A:middle
So, finally, a couple
CloudKit tips and tricks.

986
00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:57.866 A:middle
So, we already went over this

987
00:45:57.866 --> 00:46:00.286 A:middle
in the intro talk
about error handling.

988
00:46:00.716 --> 00:46:02.346 A:middle
Please handle your
errors in CloudKit.

989
00:46:02.416 --> 00:46:03.486 A:middle
This is really important.

990
00:46:03.536 --> 00:46:07.496 A:middle
I know error handling is
hard and it's not fun to do,

991
00:46:07.946 --> 00:46:11.886 A:middle
but CloudKit is all based
on network communication.

992
00:46:12.526 --> 00:46:15.716 A:middle
And when you're talking over the
network, anything can go wrong.

993
00:46:16.526 --> 00:46:18.256 A:middle
You know, the network
can get dropped.

994
00:46:18.256 --> 00:46:20.096 A:middle
Because we have other
people talking

995
00:46:20.096 --> 00:46:21.706 A:middle
to the server, we
can get conflicts.

996
00:46:21.706 --> 00:46:22.526 A:middle
We can get errors.

997
00:46:23.146 --> 00:46:26.646 A:middle
All kinds of things can
happen, and as Paul said

998
00:46:26.646 --> 00:46:29.876 A:middle
in the first talk, this is the
difference between a working app

999
00:46:29.876 --> 00:46:30.976 A:middle
and a not working app.

1000
00:46:30.976 --> 00:46:34.606 A:middle
It's not the difference between
a good app and a great app.

1001
00:46:34.606 --> 00:46:36.096 A:middle
If you don't handle errors,

1002
00:46:36.176 --> 00:46:39.446 A:middle
your app just isn't
going to work right.

1003
00:46:39.646 --> 00:46:42.786 A:middle
In CloudKit also, we've tried
to avoid any sort of magic.

1004
00:46:42.906 --> 00:46:46.376 A:middle
We don't want to try and handle
these errors for you and figure

1005
00:46:46.376 --> 00:46:47.406 A:middle
out what might be best.

1006
00:46:47.896 --> 00:46:50.556 A:middle
We want to just tell
you what happened.

1007
00:46:50.556 --> 00:46:53.306 A:middle
We want you to be able to figure
out what you need to do next,

1008
00:46:53.306 --> 00:46:56.896 A:middle
and we want to give you all
the information to do that.

1009
00:46:57.136 --> 00:46:59.236 A:middle
So, keep in mind when you're
handling your errors here

1010
00:46:59.236 --> 00:47:01.566 A:middle
that your operations
can have partial errors.

1011
00:47:02.036 --> 00:47:05.316 A:middle
These partial errors when you're
using the NSOperation API,

1012
00:47:05.316 --> 00:47:07.746 A:middle
you might be sending
up a batch of records.

1013
00:47:08.406 --> 00:47:10.636 A:middle
And if you're saving them
to the public database,

1014
00:47:10.736 --> 00:47:12.806 A:middle
it could be the case
that just one

1015
00:47:12.806 --> 00:47:15.746 A:middle
of those records had a conflict
but the rest saved just fine.

1016
00:47:16.526 --> 00:47:18.626 A:middle
If that happens, you're
going to get a partial error,

1017
00:47:18.746 --> 00:47:20.876 A:middle
and inside of that, you're
going to find one error

1018
00:47:20.876 --> 00:47:21.966 A:middle
for the record that failed.

1019
00:47:22.816 --> 00:47:25.386 A:middle
If this was in a custom
zone, you might see

1020
00:47:25.386 --> 00:47:27.276 A:middle
that as an atomic update error.

1021
00:47:27.276 --> 00:47:30.006 A:middle
So, you might see that one
of those records failed,

1022
00:47:30.006 --> 00:47:33.366 A:middle
and the rest got the
batch error in there.

1023
00:47:34.356 --> 00:47:37.096 A:middle
And finally, we want
you to make sure

1024
00:47:37.096 --> 00:47:39.436 A:middle
that you retry any
server busy errors.

1025
00:47:40.176 --> 00:47:42.476 A:middle
It could be the case
that the, you know,

1026
00:47:42.546 --> 00:47:45.046 A:middle
a bunch of people are going at
the servers at the same time

1027
00:47:45.046 --> 00:47:46.236 A:middle
and the servers can't handle it

1028
00:47:46.236 --> 00:47:47.906 A:middle
and they need clients
to back off.

1029
00:47:48.096 --> 00:47:50.686 A:middle
It could also be that
your client is misbehaving

1030
00:47:50.686 --> 00:47:52.286 A:middle
and hitting the server
too frequently,

1031
00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:55.686 A:middle
and the server is saying,
"Slow down, buddy."

1032
00:47:55.686 --> 00:47:57.556 A:middle
This is our way of
saying, "You know,

1033
00:47:57.556 --> 00:47:58.656 A:middle
we need a little more time.

1034
00:47:58.656 --> 00:48:00.796 A:middle
This request was OK, but
please try it again".

1035
00:48:01.426 --> 00:48:03.556 A:middle
And anytime we give you
a server busy error,

1036
00:48:03.556 --> 00:48:06.496 A:middle
we're going to hand back
a CKErrorRetryAfterKey.

1037
00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:09.456 A:middle
This is a number of seconds
that we'd like you to wait

1038
00:48:09.456 --> 00:48:11.426 A:middle
and retry your request.

1039
00:48:14.116 --> 00:48:17.046 A:middle
So, limits, in the
keynote, it was mentioned

1040
00:48:17.046 --> 00:48:18.936 A:middle
that CloudKit is
free with limits.

1041
00:48:19.556 --> 00:48:21.326 A:middle
How do those limits work?

1042
00:48:21.326 --> 00:48:25.116 A:middle
Well, anything stored in the
public database is counted

1043
00:48:25.116 --> 00:48:26.336 A:middle
against your app's quota.

1044
00:48:26.386 --> 00:48:29.766 A:middle
We give every app a
quota, and that's just

1045
00:48:29.766 --> 00:48:30.626 A:middle
for the public database.

1046
00:48:31.726 --> 00:48:34.086 A:middle
Anything you put in the
private database is counted

1047
00:48:34.086 --> 00:48:35.516 A:middle
against the user's account.

1048
00:48:35.706 --> 00:48:39.656 A:middle
So, every iCloud account gets
5 gigabytes of free storage,

1049
00:48:40.146 --> 00:48:43.446 A:middle
but users might have bought
more, or they might have filled

1050
00:48:43.446 --> 00:48:46.356 A:middle
up all that space with
emails or backups or photos.

1051
00:48:46.866 --> 00:48:48.796 A:middle
So, every user is going
to have a different amount

1052
00:48:48.796 --> 00:48:49.516 A:middle
of storage in there.

1053
00:48:50.126 --> 00:48:52.216 A:middle
And because this is
kind of the user space

1054
00:48:52.216 --> 00:48:54.116 A:middle
and it's shared space,
we want you to, you know,

1055
00:48:54.346 --> 00:48:55.916 A:middle
remember to be nice
to your users.

1056
00:48:55.916 --> 00:49:01.086 A:middle
It's technically free space for
you because it's theirs but,

1057
00:49:01.086 --> 00:49:03.326 A:middle
you know, don't fill it
up with unnecessary stuff.

1058
00:49:03.906 --> 00:49:08.226 A:middle
So again, with the
limits, how much do you get

1059
00:49:08.226 --> 00:49:09.096 A:middle
for your app container?

1060
00:49:09.096 --> 00:49:10.766 A:middle
Well, what we're concerned

1061
00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:13.666 A:middle
with here is customers
having a great experience,

1062
00:49:14.166 --> 00:49:17.536 A:middle
and these limits that we've
specified here are really

1063
00:49:17.576 --> 00:49:19.056 A:middle
to try and prevent abuse.

1064
00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.936 A:middle
We don't want to
prevent legitimate use.

1065
00:49:20.936 --> 00:49:23.446 A:middle
We just don't want
anyone abusing CloudKit.

1066
00:49:24.496 --> 00:49:26.736 A:middle
And the numbers that we
give you here also scale

1067
00:49:26.736 --> 00:49:28.356 A:middle
with the number of
users you have.

1068
00:49:28.356 --> 00:49:29.946 A:middle
If you go on
developer.apple.com,

1069
00:49:29.946 --> 00:49:32.666 A:middle
you can get the full breakdown
of the different values,

1070
00:49:32.666 --> 00:49:36.916 A:middle
but as an example, if you had
10 million users of your app,

1071
00:49:36.916 --> 00:49:39.486 A:middle
we're going to give you a
petabyte of asset storage,

1072
00:49:39.486 --> 00:49:41.186 A:middle
10 terabytes of database
storage,

1073
00:49:41.186 --> 00:49:44.676 A:middle
some pretty high transfer
limits, and this is all

1074
00:49:44.766 --> 00:49:46.986 A:middle
for your public database
in your application.

1075
00:49:49.556 --> 00:49:51.666 A:middle
So, finally, a note
on efficiency.

1076
00:49:52.336 --> 00:49:54.916 A:middle
One thing about CloudKit
is, again,

1077
00:49:54.916 --> 00:49:56.876 A:middle
it's a transport mechanism.

1078
00:49:56.876 --> 00:49:59.976 A:middle
We are only there to talk to
the iCloud servers for you.

1079
00:50:00.676 --> 00:50:02.636 A:middle
We're not storing any records.

1080
00:50:02.636 --> 00:50:03.796 A:middle
We're not caching records.

1081
00:50:04.316 --> 00:50:06.456 A:middle
Anytime we give you back
a record, it's something

1082
00:50:06.456 --> 00:50:07.536 A:middle
that we got from the server.

1083
00:50:08.156 --> 00:50:10.206 A:middle
We're trying to be as
transparent about that

1084
00:50:10.206 --> 00:50:13.876 A:middle
as possible and not do any
caching shenanigans here.

1085
00:50:13.876 --> 00:50:16.326 A:middle
We're always just giving
you what the server gave us.

1086
00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:21.116 A:middle
In terms of efficiency
though, you might remember

1087
00:50:21.166 --> 00:50:23.226 A:middle
from the save policies
that we're only going

1088
00:50:23.226 --> 00:50:25.366 A:middle
to save the values that
have changed on the records.

1089
00:50:25.366 --> 00:50:27.856 A:middle
So, we try and be smart about
what we send over the wire.

1090
00:50:29.106 --> 00:50:30.846 A:middle
When we're sending up assets,

1091
00:50:30.956 --> 00:50:33.586 A:middle
those can be potentially
really big blobs of data,

1092
00:50:34.246 --> 00:50:36.496 A:middle
and that data is
transferred efficiently.

1093
00:50:36.496 --> 00:50:38.896 A:middle
So, if the server already
has a copy of a file,

1094
00:50:39.306 --> 00:50:40.306 A:middle
we won't re-upload it.

1095
00:50:40.486 --> 00:50:42.236 A:middle
If we already have
that file locally,

1096
00:50:42.236 --> 00:50:46.506 A:middle
we don't need to re-download it.

1097
00:50:46.696 --> 00:50:50.076 A:middle
So, in summary, we're really
excited about CloudKit here.

1098
00:50:50.076 --> 00:50:52.446 A:middle
We've built a lot of
really great features

1099
00:50:52.926 --> 00:50:55.306 A:middle
and it's something that
we actually use at Apple.

1100
00:50:55.306 --> 00:50:58.466 A:middle
We've built iCloud Drive, we've
built iCloud Photos on top

1101
00:50:58.466 --> 00:51:02.326 A:middle
of this, and we want you guys to
start using the same technology

1102
00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:03.646 A:middle
that we're using at Apple.

1103
00:51:04.536 --> 00:51:06.906 A:middle
I'm really excited to see
what's going to happen.

1104
00:51:06.906 --> 00:51:09.036 A:middle
I can't wait to see some
apps that use CloudKit,

1105
00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:12.376 A:middle
and good luck with
using CloudKit.

00:51:21.676 --> 00:51:24.816 A:middle
So, if you need any, if
you need to contact anyone,

1108
00:51:24.816 --> 00:51:26.316 A:middle
Dave DeLong is our Evangelist.

1109
00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:28.376 A:middle
He's the guy with the bowtie.

1110
00:51:28.426 --> 00:51:31.976 A:middle
If you need documentation,
it's on developer.apple.com.

1111
00:51:31.976 --> 00:51:35.086 A:middle
We had a Introducing CloudKit
session earlier in the week.

1112
00:51:35.246 --> 00:51:37.836 A:middle
There's a couple more
related sessions.

1113
00:51:38.876 --> 00:51:39.216 A:middle
Thank you.
