1
00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:14.296 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:20.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:21.936 A:middle
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:23.266 A:middle
So my name is Kevin McLaughlin.

5
00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:26.386 A:middle
And I am here this afternoon
to tell you about HomeKit.

6
00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:29.906 A:middle
I know it has been a day
packed full of all kinds

7
00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:32.476 A:middle
of new information, but I hope
you are very excited to be here

8
00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:34.626 A:middle
as I am excited to
see everybody here.

9
00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:40.546 A:middle
So you've heard a little bit
about HomeKit already, I assume.

10
00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:44.926 A:middle
Let's talk about it just as
we're getting started here.

11
00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:53.576 A:middle
So HomeKit is a new feature
for iOS that is bringing,

12
00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:59.016 A:middle
as Craig said very well, some
rationality to home automation.

13
00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:07.286 A:middle
It provides a great opportunity
for us, you as developers and us

14
00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:11.176 A:middle
to work together to provide a
much more consistent experience

15
00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:14.646 A:middle
for our users as they start
to get into home automation.

16
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.966 A:middle
And we want to bring this
to a much wider audience

17
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:25.506 A:middle
than home automation has really
been accessible to in the past.

18
00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:27.106 A:middle
So let's get started.

19
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.426 A:middle
So today I will tell you a
little bit about the features

20
00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:34.096 A:middle
of HomeKit, and we'll go
through the core concepts,

21
00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:36.536 A:middle
how to use the APIs,
how to get started,

22
00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:41.586 A:middle
and then a few advanced topics
that are either interesting

23
00:01:41.586 --> 00:01:44.226 A:middle
to me and hopefully to you, or
I know are interesting to you.

24
00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:46.616 A:middle
So let's get on with it.

25
00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:50.486 A:middle
So the first feature I want
to tell you about is something

26
00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.706 A:middle
that is really important
and is core

27
00:01:52.706 --> 00:01:57.736 A:middle
to delivering a consistency
that I talked about.

28
00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.286 A:middle
So we have a Common Database
that is stored in iOS,

29
00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:05.836 A:middle
and it contains all of
the home information,

30
00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:09.226 A:middle
all of the accessory information
that has been configured

31
00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:15.276 A:middle
and is available to
all of your apps.

32
00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:18.566 A:middle
Every time a user
uses one of your apps

33
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:22.326 A:middle
to configure a new accessory,
to set up their home,

34
00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:26.056 A:middle
to set up some other operation,
those things are stored

35
00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.506 A:middle
through HomeKit,
through the framework,

36
00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:29.626 A:middle
in this Common Database.

37
00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:31.796 A:middle
And then when the user
uses another application

38
00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:35.666 A:middle
for some other purpose
and they see some

39
00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:38.686 A:middle
of their home information
in this other application,

40
00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:41.346 A:middle
they're going to see the same
information that they saw

41
00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:43.206 A:middle
or that they set up in
their other applications.

42
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:49.006 A:middle
And this means to our users, to
your users, everything is going

43
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:51.206 A:middle
to look a lot more
connected, and it's going

44
00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:52.426 A:middle
to make a lot more sense.

45
00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:56.326 A:middle
This is starting to provide
that consistent experience

46
00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:00.866 A:middle
that we want to deliver.

47
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:06.116 A:middle
Now building on that, as
we mentioned yesterday,

48
00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:10.346 A:middle
we have a great interface
for users, which is Siri.

49
00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:15.926 A:middle
So users can use
Siri to interact

50
00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:21.086 A:middle
with their HomeKit accessories
in a very natural way

51
00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:23.226 A:middle
by just speaking
commands that make sense.

52
00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:26.006 A:middle
I'll talk a little bit about
how that's enabled as we go

53
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.656 A:middle
through the presentation today.

54
00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:35.686 A:middle
Now in creating HomeKit, we
have put in a lot of effort

55
00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:42.006 A:middle
to define a common language
for us to use to talk

56
00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:50.396 A:middle
to accessories, but we can't
define every kind of accessory

57
00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:53.806 A:middle
that all of our clever accessory
manufacturers are going

58
00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:54.356 A:middle
to invent.

59
00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:58.196 A:middle
I've already heard about
dozens of interesting things

60
00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:03.026 A:middle
that are well beyond
what we're starting with.

61
00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:06.446 A:middle
So you can see here,
garage door, light bulb,

62
00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.836 A:middle
door lock-these are things
that are common accessories

63
00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:12.726 A:middle
that we have defined in
HomeKit, and I'll talk some more

64
00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:15.016 A:middle
about that as well, but
anything else is possible.

65
00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:20.625 A:middle
We don't want HomeKit to be
restricted and contained.

66
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:25.446 A:middle
We want HomeKit to create
innovation and creativity.

67
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:30.716 A:middle
And so anything that an
accessory manufacturer can

68
00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:35.876 A:middle
imagine and can create, they
can define and make available

69
00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:38.536 A:middle
through HomeKit to
your applications.

70
00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:46.076 A:middle
And all of that is exciting,
but you want to be able

71
00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:48.606 A:middle
to use these accessories.

72
00:04:49.316 --> 00:04:56.236 A:middle
And so HomeKit also
provides access

73
00:04:56.236 --> 00:04:59.396 A:middle
to your HomeKit accessories
when you are not at home.

74
00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:03.236 A:middle
This is enabled through
iOS device connectivity.

75
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:07.776 A:middle
And there's no special
requirement for your application

76
00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:09.926 A:middle
or for the accessories
to take advantage

77
00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.066 A:middle
of this great feature
of HomeKit.

78
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:17.826 A:middle
But with all of that
connectivity comes something

79
00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:18.586 A:middle
very important.

80
00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:22.186 A:middle
It's actually a pair of things
that are very closely coupled.

81
00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:23.926 A:middle
That's security and privacy.

82
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.656 A:middle
We take security and
privacy very seriously.

83
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:31.556 A:middle
And we have spent a lot of
time and effort, attention,

84
00:05:31.556 --> 00:05:32.656 A:middle
reviews after reviews,

85
00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:34.416 A:middle
making sure that we have
a great solution here.

86
00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.786 A:middle
So we have end-to-end encryption

87
00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:38.866 A:middle
between iOS devices
and accessories.

88
00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:47.436 A:middle
And this enables
us to have security

89
00:05:47.436 --> 00:05:50.296 A:middle
so that accessories
can't be misused.

90
00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:54.426 A:middle
It also enables us to ensure
user privacy is maintained.

91
00:05:55.426 --> 00:06:00.046 A:middle
We don't think that it's good
enough to be sort of private,

92
00:06:00.816 --> 00:06:02.636 A:middle
your data stored somewhere else.

93
00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:08.956 A:middle
We think it's important to
take privacy very seriously

94
00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:11.086 A:middle
and do the best that
is possible.

95
00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:18.426 A:middle
In keeping with this paradigm
of ensuring privacy and security

96
00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:21.516 A:middle
and making sure that our users
have really good, reliable,

97
00:06:21.516 --> 00:06:23.106 A:middle
understandable experiences

98
00:06:23.106 --> 00:06:25.706 A:middle
when they start using
your HomeKit applications,

99
00:06:27.696 --> 00:06:29.406 A:middle
HomeKit APIs can only be used

100
00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:31.116 A:middle
when your application
is in the foreground.

101
00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:34.236 A:middle
This ensures that users know
exactly what's going on.

102
00:06:34.696 --> 00:06:36.626 A:middle
There's nothing for them to
be afraid of when they take

103
00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:40.586 A:middle
that first step or second step
into using home automation.

104
00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:45.506 A:middle
OK. So that's enough about
the high-level stuff.

105
00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:47.596 A:middle
Let's get into some
of the details.

106
00:06:48.326 --> 00:06:52.386 A:middle
So, to get started with HomeKit,

107
00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:56.656 A:middle
your entry point is
the Home Manager.

108
00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:02.986 A:middle
The Home Manager provides your
pointers to the common database,

109
00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:05.116 A:middle
accessed through the homes.

110
00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:09.156 A:middle
The Home Manager allows your
application to manage the homes:

111
00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:15.266 A:middle
which one is primary, adding
or removing homes as necessary,

112
00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:18.306 A:middle
and will notify you of changes.

113
00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:22.826 A:middle
Now, for example, somebody
might have, for whatever reason,

114
00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:23.826 A:middle
multiple homes set up.

115
00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:24.656 A:middle
Those might change.

116
00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.146 A:middle
This is where you would
get notified about that.

117
00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:27.916 A:middle
So you can start
updating your application

118
00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:31.316 A:middle
to match what the
user knows they have.

119
00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:33.536 A:middle
So the Home Manager
is represented

120
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.096 A:middle
by the HMHomeManager class.

121
00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:41.176 A:middle
You simply create an instance of
it, and then you set a delegate

122
00:07:41.626 --> 00:07:42.646 A:middle
to be your application.

123
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:49.666 A:middle
To use the Home Manager,
the most important thing,

124
00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:51.026 A:middle
the first thing you
want to do is you want

125
00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:53.276 A:middle
to implement this
delegate callback

126
00:07:53.926 --> 00:07:55.506 A:middle
homeManagerDidUpdateHomes.

127
00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:57.806 A:middle
When you get this callback,

128
00:07:57.806 --> 00:08:01.666 A:middle
that means that the Home
Manager has finished loading

129
00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:03.336 A:middle
or preparing the home data.

130
00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:08.136 A:middle
And you can now save a
pointer to the array of homes.

131
00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:11.636 A:middle
And you can also save
what is currently set

132
00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:13.616 A:middle
as the primary home.

133
00:08:14.106 --> 00:08:18.316 A:middle
Now if there aren't any
homes, then you'll need

134
00:08:18.316 --> 00:08:19.736 A:middle
to create a home for the user.

135
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.436 A:middle
So you add a home with name.

136
00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:27.126 A:middle
And that completes with
a completionHandler.

137
00:08:27.126 --> 00:08:31.626 A:middle
It would only fail likely if
the home had the same name

138
00:08:31.626 --> 00:08:37.486 A:middle
as another home because homes
need to be uniquely named.

139
00:08:37.966 --> 00:08:41.226 A:middle
So homes contain all
of the data for a home.

140
00:08:41.226 --> 00:08:43.806 A:middle
So you have your rooms, you have
your accessories, and so on.

141
00:08:44.326 --> 00:08:46.626 A:middle
It notifies you of
changes to that home.

142
00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:51.406 A:middle
And the names of homes
are recognized by Siri

143
00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:54.166 A:middle
so that users can refer to them
when they are giving commands.

144
00:08:54.736 --> 00:09:01.966 A:middle
On a home we have the name, we
have an array of all the rooms,

145
00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:04.096 A:middle
and an array of all
the accessories

146
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:09.036 A:middle
that are in that home.

147
00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:13.266 A:middle
To fill out the concept or the
image or the map of a home,

148
00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:16.006 A:middle
whatever you want to call it,
you'll need to create rooms.

149
00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:20.916 A:middle
So on the home you can create
a room or add a room with name,

150
00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:24.286 A:middle
provide a name for
the room, and, again,

151
00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:26.496 A:middle
that would only fail
typically if there was a room

152
00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:30.016 A:middle
that already had the same name.

153
00:09:30.016 --> 00:09:32.026 A:middle
So, moving on to rooms.

154
00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:34.066 A:middle
Rooms contain accessories.

155
00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:38.446 A:middle
A room, again, will
notify you of changes.

156
00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:43.926 A:middle
And rooms must be uniquely
named within a home.

157
00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:47.016 A:middle
So a home creates
its own namespace.

158
00:09:47.466 --> 00:09:51.946 A:middle
Everything within a home
must have a unique name.

159
00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:53.876 A:middle
Names of rooms are
recognized by Siri.

160
00:09:54.096 --> 00:09:55.746 A:middle
So users can also
interact with them

161
00:09:55.746 --> 00:09:57.846 A:middle
to make some nice
natural interactions

162
00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:58.786 A:middle
with their accessories.

163
00:09:59.886 --> 00:10:01.976 A:middle
Rooms are represented
by the HMRoom class.

164
00:10:03.726 --> 00:10:06.366 A:middle
And they have an array
of the accessories

165
00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:07.166 A:middle
that are in that room.

166
00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:10.086 A:middle
Let's move on to accessories.

167
00:10:10.686 --> 00:10:14.106 A:middle
So an accessory corresponds
to a physical device.

168
00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:18.426 A:middle
Accessories are assigned to
a room, and that can change.

169
00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:20.296 A:middle
You can assign an accessory
to a different room.

170
00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:25.216 A:middle
Accessory objects allow you
to access the device state.

171
00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:28.296 A:middle
Can I talk to this accessory
right now, for example.

172
00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:32.216 A:middle
It will notify you of
changes to that accessory.

173
00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:35.126 A:middle
Again, they have to be
uniquely named within a home.

174
00:10:36.306 --> 00:10:40.146 A:middle
And names of accessories
also are recognized by Siri.

175
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:50.566 A:middle
An accessory is the whole object
that the user is referring to.

176
00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:53.836 A:middle
And I'll talk about
how the details

177
00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:57.566 A:middle
of that accessory are exposed
and made available after this.

178
00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:01.766 A:middle
So an accessory has a pointer
back to the room that it's in,

179
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:05.566 A:middle
and it has a pointer to
the array of services

180
00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:07.786 A:middle
that represent the
functionality of that accessory.

181
00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:15.546 A:middle
An important delegate
callback for you to implement

182
00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:19.586 A:middle
on accessory is the
DidUpdateReachability callback.

183
00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:23.376 A:middle
So an accessory at any point
in time may be reachable.

184
00:11:23.376 --> 00:11:24.916 A:middle
You may be able to
communicate with it

185
00:11:24.916 --> 00:11:27.706 A:middle
from your application,
or you may not.

186
00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:28.356 A:middle
It may be off.

187
00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:32.686 A:middle
You may be far away
from it, in a situation

188
00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:33.816 A:middle
where you don't have access.

189
00:11:33.816 --> 00:11:40.066 A:middle
In this case, this callback will
be given to your application

190
00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.636 A:middle
to let you know when that
reachability changes.

191
00:11:42.756 --> 00:11:45.636 A:middle
So you might start out with an
accessory that is not reachable,

192
00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:47.916 A:middle
and then if for some reason
it becomes reachable you'll be

193
00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.216 A:middle
notified, and then
you can update the UI

194
00:11:49.216 --> 00:11:50.756 A:middle
in your application to reflect

195
00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:52.576 A:middle
that so the user
knows what's going on.

196
00:11:54.276 --> 00:11:58.896 A:middle
So to describe a little bit
more about how accessories look,

197
00:11:59.576 --> 00:12:01.756 A:middle
let's talk about services.

198
00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:05.826 A:middle
So services represent
functionality of accessories.

199
00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:09.396 A:middle
They contain characteristics.

200
00:12:09.686 --> 00:12:14.036 A:middle
So you could describe a service
as a grouping of characteristics

201
00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:16.776 A:middle
where characteristics are
specific parameters you could

202
00:12:16.776 --> 00:12:18.546 A:middle
interact with, and I'll
talk about those next.

203
00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:23.216 A:middle
So, services are interesting
in that they may have a name.

204
00:12:24.396 --> 00:12:27.056 A:middle
And what that means is
there are some services

205
00:12:27.056 --> 00:12:30.006 A:middle
that really aren't
intended for the user

206
00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:32.226 A:middle
to directly interact with them.

207
00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:32.886 A:middle
They're sort of more

208
00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:35.156 A:middle
of an operational
type of functionality.

209
00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:37.676 A:middle
So here, for example,
we have a light bulb.

210
00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:40.496 A:middle
A service that has a light bulb
would typically have a name

211
00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:41.986 A:middle
because the user is
going to want to name it.

212
00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:44.056 A:middle
And if that light has
a name, I refer to it.

213
00:12:44.626 --> 00:12:49.106 A:middle
But a service to update firmware
on an accessory is something

214
00:12:49.106 --> 00:12:52.476 A:middle
that a user typically would
not need to name and refer

215
00:12:52.476 --> 00:12:53.546 A:middle
to in many different ways.

216
00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:55.846 A:middle
It's something that your
application would take care

217
00:12:55.846 --> 00:13:00.196 A:middle
of for them, present that
in a more user friendly way

218
00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.866 A:middle
than saying "Oh, here's your
firmware update service,

219
00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:04.846 A:middle
and here's the data
that goes into it."

220
00:13:05.296 --> 00:13:08.646 A:middle
So in your UI, generally
you will not expose

221
00:13:08.646 --> 00:13:09.746 A:middle
unnamed services.

222
00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:13.776 A:middle
So this is a way that some of
the messiness, if you will,

223
00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:15.586 A:middle
or the, you could look at it
in a different way and some

224
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:18.246 A:middle
of the great functionality
of the protocol

225
00:13:18.276 --> 00:13:21.916 A:middle
and of HomeKit framework don't
need to be exposed to users

226
00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:23.646 A:middle
who just want to interact

227
00:13:23.646 --> 00:13:26.586 A:middle
with these accessories
that they've bought.

228
00:13:26.976 --> 00:13:29.906 A:middle
Names of services must
be unique within a home,

229
00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:32.046 A:middle
and they are recognized by Siri.

230
00:13:32.386 --> 00:13:36.236 A:middle
And importantly for services,
we not only recognize names

231
00:13:36.236 --> 00:13:40.066 A:middle
of services, but also we have
Apple-defined service types.

232
00:13:40.066 --> 00:13:42.866 A:middle
And Siri understands
those types,

233
00:13:43.076 --> 00:13:44.296 A:middle
which means that users can refer

234
00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:48.006 A:middle
to service types using
natural language, and synonyms

235
00:13:48.006 --> 00:13:48.926 A:middle
and other things like that,

236
00:13:48.926 --> 00:13:53.546 A:middle
that may not be exactly the
name provided to the service.

237
00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:58.156 A:middle
Services are represented
in HMService.

238
00:13:58.156 --> 00:14:01.316 A:middle
We have a name, an array
of characteristics,

239
00:14:01.316 --> 00:14:03.556 A:middle
the service type of the service,

240
00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:06.846 A:middle
and a pointer back
to the accessory.

241
00:14:07.506 --> 00:14:10.326 A:middle
The services are a
collection of characteristics.

242
00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:13.646 A:middle
A good example, just
as it shows here is,

243
00:14:13.966 --> 00:14:15.716 A:middle
for a light bulb service,

244
00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.806 A:middle
your main characteristic
is the power state

245
00:14:20.766 --> 00:14:22.836 A:middle
of that light bulb service,

246
00:14:22.836 --> 00:14:24.616 A:middle
and so the power state
is a characteristic

247
00:14:24.616 --> 00:14:27.256 A:middle
that you can directly
interact with.

248
00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:31.196 A:middle
Characteristics provide some
information, some metadata

249
00:14:31.196 --> 00:14:32.236 A:middle
about the characteristics.

250
00:14:32.236 --> 00:14:33.356 A:middle
So they are self-describing.

251
00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:37.106 A:middle
So you might get a range,
you might get units,

252
00:14:37.106 --> 00:14:38.476 A:middle
step values, and so on.

253
00:14:38.476 --> 00:14:41.326 A:middle
So you can display
appropriate controls to a user

254
00:14:41.326 --> 00:14:42.396 A:middle
when you get a characteristic.

255
00:14:43.696 --> 00:14:48.066 A:middle
You get the results
through a completion handler

256
00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:50.016 A:middle
because it may not be immediate.

257
00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.966 A:middle
And characteristics
are recognized

258
00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:53.856 A:middle
by Siri although they are
not named by the user.

259
00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:59.546 A:middle
So we've defined a number
of characteristic types,

260
00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:02.696 A:middle
and Siri can understand
what those mean,

261
00:15:02.696 --> 00:15:03.656 A:middle
so you just can interact

262
00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:05.396 A:middle
with those giving
commands through Siri.

263
00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:09.846 A:middle
The characteristics can
be of a few varieties.

264
00:15:10.946 --> 00:15:14.746 A:middle
With these main ones,
so some characteristics,

265
00:15:14.746 --> 00:15:16.416 A:middle
you only read the
values from them.

266
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:20.316 A:middle
So you might say, "What is the
current temperature outside

267
00:15:20.856 --> 00:15:21.526 A:middle
or inside?"

268
00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:22.266 A:middle
You have a thermostat.

269
00:15:22.266 --> 00:15:23.256 A:middle
It tells you the
current temperature.

270
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.996 A:middle
You don't need to write to
the current temperature.

271
00:15:24.996 --> 00:15:27.996 A:middle
You can't directly,
immediately change

272
00:15:27.996 --> 00:15:31.556 A:middle
that with a digital command,
but you read from it.

273
00:15:32.386 --> 00:15:33.906 A:middle
When you want to
change the temperature,

274
00:15:33.906 --> 00:15:35.056 A:middle
you need to tell your thermostat

275
00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.946 A:middle
that you have a new
target temperature.

276
00:15:37.196 --> 00:15:39.916 A:middle
So your target temperature is
something that you do write to,

277
00:15:40.196 --> 00:15:43.606 A:middle
and you may also read from
that because you might say,

278
00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:46.006 A:middle
"Why is it so hot in here?

279
00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:50.356 A:middle
What is the current target
temperature of this thermostat?"

280
00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:52.376 A:middle
So you read that, and then maybe
you write it and change it.

281
00:15:53.316 --> 00:15:56.346 A:middle
And there are some
few characteristics

282
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:57.966 A:middle
that you only write to.

283
00:15:58.346 --> 00:16:01.656 A:middle
A write-only characteristic
is something,

284
00:16:01.906 --> 00:16:05.936 A:middle
think about it a little bit,
but where you tell the accessory

285
00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:08.256 A:middle
to do something, and
it's going to do it,

286
00:16:08.256 --> 00:16:12.816 A:middle
and it doesn't matter what it
may have to say back to you.

287
00:16:12.816 --> 00:16:13.656 A:middle
There's no feedback.

288
00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:15.926 A:middle
It just, the accessory does
it independently on its own.

289
00:16:16.826 --> 00:16:18.846 A:middle
So an example here,
and an important one,

290
00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:20.356 A:middle
is the identify characteristic,

291
00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:22.026 A:middle
which is a special
characteristic

292
00:16:22.026 --> 00:16:24.636 A:middle
that all accessories
must support,

293
00:16:24.636 --> 00:16:29.586 A:middle
and it provides an interface
where from your application,

294
00:16:29.586 --> 00:16:33.596 A:middle
you can let a user say, "Hey,
I'd like you to help me find

295
00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:35.956 A:middle
out which one of my
accessories this is."

296
00:16:35.956 --> 00:16:38.966 A:middle
So you send an identify
characteristic right

297
00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:40.166 A:middle
to that accessory.

298
00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:44.326 A:middle
And then it will do something

299
00:16:44.866 --> 00:16:46.366 A:middle
that identifies itself
to the user.

300
00:16:46.366 --> 00:16:48.016 A:middle
So a light bulb might flash.

301
00:16:48.016 --> 00:16:50.416 A:middle
A thermostat might blink an LED.

302
00:16:50.416 --> 00:16:52.446 A:middle
A garage door opener or
an IP camera might beep,

303
00:16:52.996 --> 00:16:53.986 A:middle
maybe also flash a light.

304
00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:56.026 A:middle
Whatever it is, this
is accessory specific.

305
00:16:56.026 --> 00:17:00.426 A:middle
And the purpose is to help the
user know which thing they are

306
00:17:00.426 --> 00:17:01.496 A:middle
about to interact with.

307
00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:04.965 A:middle
It's especially useful when
a user, for example, say,

308
00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:06.906 A:middle
connects several lights.

309
00:17:07.086 --> 00:17:07.796 A:middle
And they say, "OK.

310
00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:09.026 A:middle
Now I need to set up my lights.

311
00:17:09.026 --> 00:17:09.896 A:middle
Which one is this?"

312
00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:10.336 A:middle
All right.

313
00:17:10.336 --> 00:17:12.786 A:middle
They all have the same
default information.

314
00:17:13.016 --> 00:17:14.776 A:middle
I'm not going to go look
them up by serial number.

315
00:17:14.776 --> 00:17:15.685 A:middle
That's boring.

316
00:17:16.596 --> 00:17:18.546 A:middle
So just identify that for me.

317
00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:21.996 A:middle
And you send the identify
characteristic right

318
00:17:22.076 --> 00:17:25.076 A:middle
to that accessory, it
blinks, the user knows

319
00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:26.366 A:middle
which one it is,
they can proceed.

320
00:17:27.726 --> 00:17:31.686 A:middle
So characteristics are
an HMCharacteristic.

321
00:17:32.646 --> 00:17:34.726 A:middle
You can
readValueWithCompletionHandler

322
00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:37.406 A:middle
to get the value
of a characteristic

323
00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:41.036 A:middle
and also
writeValueWithCompletionHandler.

324
00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:51.666 A:middle
So now we've talked about
these objects, these things.

325
00:17:51.666 --> 00:17:54.506 A:middle
They correspond to physical
things in the real world.

326
00:17:54.566 --> 00:17:58.256 A:middle
We need to be able to find
and set up these accessories.

327
00:17:58.996 --> 00:18:03.606 A:middle
We do that with the
Accessory Browser.

328
00:18:05.036 --> 00:18:09.056 A:middle
So this tool lets you
and your application find

329
00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:10.866 A:middle
out if there are any new
accessories available

330
00:18:10.866 --> 00:18:15.456 A:middle
and then help a user
add those to a home.

331
00:18:15.606 --> 00:18:18.576 A:middle
So you create an instance
of the Accessory Browser,

332
00:18:18.816 --> 00:18:22.286 A:middle
set the delegate, and
then, when appropriate,

333
00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:24.986 A:middle
you start searching
for new accessories.

334
00:18:26.576 --> 00:18:27.336 A:middle
You'll find some.

335
00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:28.336 A:middle
You'll remove some.

336
00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:29.356 A:middle
I'll talk about that next.

337
00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.096 A:middle
And then later when you're done,

338
00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:33.636 A:middle
you stop searching
for new accessories.

339
00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:37.066 A:middle
So it's responsible for power
management, to stop searching

340
00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:40.256 A:middle
for new accessories when it's
no longer necessary to do that.

341
00:18:40.256 --> 00:18:41.776 A:middle
You've left the view.

342
00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:42.976 A:middle
You're leaving the application.

343
00:18:42.976 --> 00:18:45.946 A:middle
You've decided that enough
time has passed and so on.

344
00:18:46.606 --> 00:18:48.576 A:middle
So while you're searching
for new accessories,

345
00:18:49.256 --> 00:18:54.656 A:middle
you will get this callback
didFindNewAccessory.

346
00:18:54.656 --> 00:18:56.656 A:middle
And it will come with a pointer
to the accessory that was found.

347
00:18:56.756 --> 00:18:59.196 A:middle
And you can now, for
example, add this to a list

348
00:18:59.196 --> 00:19:01.646 A:middle
of accessories in the UI that
the user can select from for

349
00:19:01.646 --> 00:19:04.846 A:middle
which ones they want
to configure.

350
00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.896 A:middle
If, when you start searching
there are already some

351
00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:10.176 A:middle
accessories that have been
found, you can get the list

352
00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:11.456 A:middle
from the Accessory Browser

353
00:19:11.456 --> 00:19:13.886 A:middle
of the already found
new accessories.

354
00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:17.626 A:middle
And then you'll get this
callback every time a new one is

355
00:19:17.626 --> 00:19:21.046 A:middle
added to that list.

356
00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:22.806 A:middle
When you have found the new
accessories and the user would

357
00:19:22.806 --> 00:19:26.136 A:middle
like to set one of them
up, you need to add

358
00:19:26.136 --> 00:19:27.926 A:middle
that accessory to a home.

359
00:19:28.196 --> 00:19:34.916 A:middle
And it's important to note
that this method is on HMHome.

360
00:19:35.566 --> 00:19:37.026 A:middle
It's not on the Accessory
Browser.

361
00:19:37.836 --> 00:19:41.686 A:middle
So we add the accessory
to a home.

362
00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:44.626 A:middle
When the accessory is
successfully added to a home,

363
00:19:44.626 --> 00:19:51.006 A:middle
it's time to name the accessory
and assign it to a room.

364
00:19:51.116 --> 00:19:52.916 A:middle
Also while you're searching
for new accessories,

365
00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:54.696 A:middle
you will sometimes
get this callback.

366
00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.456 A:middle
Especially, you will
get this callback

367
00:19:56.456 --> 00:19:58.176 A:middle
when you add an accessory
to a home.

368
00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.776 A:middle
This is didRemoveNewAccessory.

369
00:20:01.806 --> 00:20:05.186 A:middle
This allows you in your UI when
you have a list of accessories

370
00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:07.526 A:middle
that you are showing to the user
which new accessories would you

371
00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:10.216 A:middle
like to configure, and they do
select one and they do add it

372
00:20:10.216 --> 00:20:13.116 A:middle
to a home, you'll
get this callback

373
00:20:13.116 --> 00:20:16.986 A:middle
to tell you it's removed from
the list of new accessories.

374
00:20:17.736 --> 00:20:19.426 A:middle
In this case, because
it was added to a home,

375
00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:22.446 A:middle
so you can update your UI to
take that one off the list.

376
00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:27.716 A:middle
So that's a quick
introduction to how

377
00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:30.426 A:middle
to get started, basic
functionality.

378
00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:36.126 A:middle
And maybe, like I
have been recently,

379
00:20:36.126 --> 00:20:38.316 A:middle
you'd like to get right
into it and write something.

380
00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:42.156 A:middle
And you wonder, how are
we going to do that?

381
00:20:42.156 --> 00:20:44.086 A:middle
We don't have any of these
HomeKit accessories yet.

382
00:20:47.366 --> 00:20:48.626 A:middle
So we thought about that.

383
00:20:48.626 --> 00:20:49.646 A:middle
We came up with something.

384
00:20:50.046 --> 00:20:51.396 A:middle
We have a great solution,

385
00:20:51.396 --> 00:20:53.306 A:middle
which is the HomeKit
Accessory Simulator.

386
00:20:53.966 --> 00:20:58.296 A:middle
And this is available for you
in Xcode at this location.

387
00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:01.796 A:middle
And it's a great
tool, and I'm going

388
00:21:01.796 --> 00:21:07.966 A:middle
to show you how that works.

389
00:21:08.126 --> 00:21:08.606 A:middle
Beautiful.

390
00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:14.716 A:middle
So here is our HomeKit
Accessory Simulator.

391
00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:18.586 A:middle
Now you can see that in this
case, there are a number

392
00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:22.676 A:middle
of accessories that have already
been created in the simulator,

393
00:21:22.676 --> 00:21:23.776 A:middle
but I'll walk you through it.

394
00:21:23.776 --> 00:21:26.526 A:middle
I'm just kind of making
sure it's big enough

395
00:21:26.526 --> 00:21:27.626 A:middle
for everybody to
see in the back.

396
00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:30.666 A:middle
Come forward if you
can't see it.

397
00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:34.076 A:middle
So here on the left we have
the list of accessories

398
00:21:34.076 --> 00:21:35.696 A:middle
that are created and
Bridges, which I'll talk

399
00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:37.296 A:middle
about briefly at the end.

400
00:21:37.806 --> 00:21:39.206 A:middle
Then on the right
there's information

401
00:21:39.246 --> 00:21:40.486 A:middle
about the accessories.

402
00:21:41.016 --> 00:21:42.426 A:middle
So what I'm going to
do is I am going to go

403
00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:45.956 A:middle
down to this Add Accessory
button here on the bottom left

404
00:21:46.106 --> 00:21:48.016 A:middle
and choose to Add
a New Accessory.

405
00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:54.466 A:middle
So I'm going to call this
Garage Door Demo 213.

406
00:21:55.226 --> 00:21:56.986 A:middle
I'm going to add this accessory.

407
00:21:57.176 --> 00:22:00.336 A:middle
So you'll see now that
I've added a new accessory

408
00:22:00.536 --> 00:22:02.216 A:middle
to the accessory simulator.

409
00:22:04.016 --> 00:22:10.086 A:middle
And let me show you what
that looks like in this very,

410
00:22:10.086 --> 00:22:14.386 A:middle
very simple sample
app that we wrote.

411
00:22:14.996 --> 00:22:17.356 A:middle
So this is just a tab view.

412
00:22:17.356 --> 00:22:19.226 A:middle
You can see there are new
accessories on one tab

413
00:22:19.226 --> 00:22:21.266 A:middle
and configured accessories
on the other.

414
00:22:21.886 --> 00:22:23.666 A:middle
These other accessories
are already configured.

415
00:22:24.436 --> 00:22:30.356 A:middle
We see here that we have the
Garage Door Demo accessory

416
00:22:30.356 --> 00:22:31.876 A:middle
that I've just created
has shown up here

417
00:22:31.876 --> 00:22:33.596 A:middle
on the New Accessories tab.

418
00:22:33.796 --> 00:22:37.836 A:middle
But it's not very
interesting yet.

419
00:22:38.046 --> 00:22:40.526 A:middle
It just has an accessory
information service.

420
00:22:40.566 --> 00:22:41.616 A:middle
This is created by default

421
00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:44.346 A:middle
because all accessories
must have an accessory

422
00:22:44.346 --> 00:22:45.276 A:middle
information service.

423
00:22:45.276 --> 00:22:50.186 A:middle
So I can go up here to
add another service.

424
00:22:50.186 --> 00:22:51.686 A:middle
So this is a garage door.

425
00:22:51.686 --> 00:22:53.586 A:middle
So let's add a garage
door opener service.

426
00:22:53.586 --> 00:22:56.766 A:middle
We can see that's added with
all of these characteristics.

427
00:22:57.566 --> 00:23:00.856 A:middle
And now since garage door
openers typically also have a

428
00:23:00.856 --> 00:23:02.256 A:middle
light, let's add a light.

429
00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:08.656 A:middle
Now you see we've created our
garage door opener accessory,

430
00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:11.786 A:middle
and it has the accessory
information service.

431
00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:15.256 A:middle
It has the garage door opener
service, which corresponds

432
00:23:15.256 --> 00:23:18.206 A:middle
to the motor that actually opens
and closes the garage door.

433
00:23:18.986 --> 00:23:22.536 A:middle
And we have a light
bulb service correspond

434
00:23:22.536 --> 00:23:23.936 A:middle
to the light that's
on that garage door.

435
00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:30.626 A:middle
So let's go ahead and
configure this accessory.

436
00:23:31.296 --> 00:23:34.946 A:middle
So when we go to add
an accessory to a home,

437
00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:36.946 A:middle
the user must enter
a setup code.

438
00:23:36.946 --> 00:23:38.206 A:middle
This comes from the accessory.

439
00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:42.596 A:middle
Maybe on the packaging or
on a label or on a screen

440
00:23:42.596 --> 00:23:43.706 A:middle
or LCD on the accessory.

441
00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:47.626 A:middle
In the simulator, it's
here right under the name.

442
00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:53.396 A:middle
I see Setup Code, which
looks like it's 9143.

443
00:23:54.456 --> 00:23:55.296 A:middle
So let me enter that.

444
00:23:55.456 --> 00:24:00.816 A:middle
I'll go ahead and set that up.

445
00:24:00.816 --> 00:24:03.016 A:middle
And you can see now that
disappears from the list

446
00:24:03.016 --> 00:24:05.296 A:middle
of new accessories because
it was successfully added

447
00:24:05.396 --> 00:24:05.986 A:middle
to the home.

448
00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:14.426 A:middle
Now if I jump over here to the
Configured Accessories tab,

449
00:24:15.906 --> 00:24:23.376 A:middle
I think I saw that I have a-I'm
revealing my practicing-but here

450
00:24:23.376 --> 00:24:26.426 A:middle
we have the garage door
accessory that I've just added.

451
00:24:26.426 --> 00:24:29.866 A:middle
And you can see that it has
two services and a Details tab.

452
00:24:30.496 --> 00:24:35.266 A:middle
The Details tab shows the
accessory information.

453
00:24:35.576 --> 00:24:37.966 A:middle
This is not something that
we need to interact with,

454
00:24:37.966 --> 00:24:39.166 A:middle
but it's there for reference.

455
00:24:39.706 --> 00:24:44.306 A:middle
We can also go in and see
all of the characteristics

456
00:24:44.736 --> 00:24:46.946 A:middle
for the garage door and all

457
00:24:46.946 --> 00:24:48.196 A:middle
of the characteristics
for the light.

458
00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:55.456 A:middle
And just to show that these are
connected, we can see if I click

459
00:24:55.456 --> 00:25:00.296 A:middle
on the power characteristic
of the light,

460
00:25:01.116 --> 00:25:07.766 A:middle
the power in the light bulb
service of the garage door goes

461
00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:11.936 A:middle
on and off along with that.

462
00:25:12.266 --> 00:25:13.446 A:middle
It's sort of in the
middle up there.

463
00:25:15.226 --> 00:25:18.506 A:middle
OK. So that shows
you the basic use

464
00:25:18.506 --> 00:25:21.286 A:middle
of the HomeKit Accessory
Simulator and also showing sort

465
00:25:21.536 --> 00:25:24.426 A:middle
of the Accessory Browser in
action and adding an accessory

466
00:25:24.426 --> 00:25:26.846 A:middle
and then showing the
services and characteristics.

467
00:25:27.156 --> 00:25:29.066 A:middle
But let's come back to
Bridges for a moment.

468
00:25:29.726 --> 00:25:32.076 A:middle
So Bridges are a
special type of accessory

469
00:25:32.316 --> 00:25:36.346 A:middle
where you have one accessory

470
00:25:36.346 --> 00:25:39.936 A:middle
that supports HomeKit Accessory
Protocol that connects with iOS.

471
00:25:39.936 --> 00:25:43.996 A:middle
And then you have some
other end-point accessories

472
00:25:43.996 --> 00:25:45.366 A:middle
that are connected to the Bridge

473
00:25:45.366 --> 00:25:47.606 A:middle
because they can't
communicate directly

474
00:25:47.606 --> 00:25:48.726 A:middle
with iOS for some reason.

475
00:25:49.616 --> 00:25:51.486 A:middle
So a typical example
may be a hub

476
00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:53.066 A:middle
that has some lights behind it

477
00:25:53.066 --> 00:25:55.016 A:middle
that are using some
other protocol.

478
00:25:55.936 --> 00:26:02.416 A:middle
So in this case the hub
is the first accessory

479
00:26:02.706 --> 00:26:05.116 A:middle
that HomeKit connects to.

480
00:26:05.316 --> 00:26:07.626 A:middle
So I can come down here,
and I can Add a New Bridge.

481
00:26:08.616 --> 00:26:14.746 A:middle
So let's call this
Demo Bridge 214.

482
00:26:15.046 --> 00:26:18.406 A:middle
So I've created a Bridge.

483
00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:20.756 A:middle
Now when a Bridge is created,

484
00:26:20.756 --> 00:26:23.886 A:middle
you'll see that it is actually
an accessory that's available.

485
00:26:24.406 --> 00:26:27.126 A:middle
So if I go over to New
Accessories, that has shown up.

486
00:26:27.126 --> 00:26:28.626 A:middle
I could connect to it right now,

487
00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:30.826 A:middle
but it's really very
uninteresting.

488
00:26:32.466 --> 00:26:35.016 A:middle
We need to add some
accessories behind this Bridge.

489
00:26:35.726 --> 00:26:39.606 A:middle
So I click on Add Accessories.

490
00:26:40.416 --> 00:26:45.986 A:middle
So let's add a light
behind the Bridge.

491
00:26:46.576 --> 00:26:48.646 A:middle
Now we see we've added a
light accessory connected

492
00:26:48.646 --> 00:26:50.966 A:middle
to this Bridge.

493
00:26:51.156 --> 00:26:52.086 A:middle
While we're here, let's go ahead

494
00:26:52.086 --> 00:26:58.376 A:middle
and add another light
behind that Bridge.

495
00:26:59.386 --> 00:27:00.646 A:middle
So now we have two lights.

496
00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:03.996 A:middle
And you'll see, on the right
we show the accessories

497
00:27:03.996 --> 00:27:05.326 A:middle
that are connected to
the Bridge on the left.

498
00:27:05.926 --> 00:27:09.886 A:middle
Below the Bridge we have the
actual light accessories listed

499
00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:11.736 A:middle
here that would show
the services of those.

500
00:27:11.976 --> 00:27:14.446 A:middle
Now here, these are created only

501
00:27:14.446 --> 00:27:15.906 A:middle
with accessory information
to start.

502
00:27:15.906 --> 00:27:21.266 A:middle
Let's go ahead and
add lights to them.

503
00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:23.166 A:middle
Now if I go back and
look at the Bridge,

504
00:27:23.166 --> 00:27:24.816 A:middle
you'll see that we have
a nice view to show you

505
00:27:24.816 --> 00:27:26.726 A:middle
of the accessories that are
connected behind the Bridge.

506
00:27:27.796 --> 00:27:31.616 A:middle
And of course we can pair

507
00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:34.456 A:middle
with the Bridge just the
same way we did before,

508
00:27:34.456 --> 00:27:35.926 A:middle
and set this up.

509
00:27:36.316 --> 00:27:43.086 A:middle
8107. So that appears over here.

510
00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:45.356 A:middle
We can go down to our
Connected Accessories.

511
00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.206 A:middle
And now you're going to
see something interesting.

512
00:27:47.846 --> 00:27:50.916 A:middle
The Demo Bridges there, and
we can click on that and see

513
00:27:50.916 --> 00:27:52.076 A:middle
that it just has details,

514
00:27:52.076 --> 00:27:54.626 A:middle
which show the accessory
information of the Bridge.

515
00:27:55.826 --> 00:27:57.716 A:middle
But the lights are also here.

516
00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:01.016 A:middle
So lights that are behind a
Bridge are presented to you

517
00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:03.586 A:middle
through HomeKit like
separate accessories.

518
00:28:03.586 --> 00:28:05.186 A:middle
And you can interact directly

519
00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:07.396 A:middle
with those lights even though
there's something in the middle

520
00:28:07.396 --> 00:28:08.816 A:middle
and there's always
protocol translation

521
00:28:08.816 --> 00:28:09.896 A:middle
and other things going on.

522
00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:12.816 A:middle
You don't have to
worry about that.

523
00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:14.796 A:middle
You get the accessory, which
is what the user really

524
00:28:14.796 --> 00:28:15.316 A:middle
cares about.

525
00:28:15.316 --> 00:28:20.046 A:middle
And so you can then interact
directly with these accessories.

526
00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:27.586 A:middle
They can be turned
on and off similarly.

527
00:28:27.626 --> 00:28:31.826 A:middle
OK. So that is the demo.

528
00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:37.896 A:middle
So let's get back to our slides.

529
00:28:38.556 --> 00:28:43.006 A:middle
Perfect. So the HomeKit
Accessory Simulator is available

530
00:28:43.006 --> 00:28:43.966 A:middle
in Xcode 6.

531
00:28:44.766 --> 00:28:46.336 A:middle
It acts just like
real accessories,

532
00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:48.606 A:middle
so when you develop your
application using the simulator,

533
00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:50.456 A:middle
using the HomeKit
Accessory Simulator,

534
00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:52.606 A:middle
you're doing the real thing.

535
00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:55.476 A:middle
When you eventually get real
accessories to connect to,

536
00:28:55.726 --> 00:28:56.686 A:middle
they're going to
work the same way.

537
00:28:56.686 --> 00:28:57.466 A:middle
They're going to be exposed

538
00:28:57.466 --> 00:28:58.996 A:middle
to you the same way
through HomeKit.

539
00:28:59.716 --> 00:29:02.906 A:middle
So this is a great way for you
to get started and a great way

540
00:29:02.906 --> 00:29:04.966 A:middle
for you to develop and test
your HomeKit applications.

541
00:29:05.606 --> 00:29:10.416 A:middle
So during this presentation
so far, we've talked

542
00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:14.326 A:middle
about all the steps at various
points along the way for how

543
00:29:14.326 --> 00:29:18.006 A:middle
to get the initial
setup of a home

544
00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:19.626 A:middle
and getting accessories added.

545
00:29:19.626 --> 00:29:20.386 A:middle
We've talked about this.

546
00:29:20.476 --> 00:29:23.466 A:middle
And I want to run through it
for you just as a summary.

547
00:29:23.766 --> 00:29:25.366 A:middle
So first we need
to create a home.

548
00:29:25.456 --> 00:29:27.466 A:middle
The user provides a
name for the home.

549
00:29:27.906 --> 00:29:30.536 A:middle
Then we need to add
rooms to the home.

550
00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:32.976 A:middle
The user provides
names for those rooms.

551
00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:35.886 A:middle
Again, all these names
will have to be unique.

552
00:29:36.206 --> 00:29:39.276 A:middle
And then we add accessories.

553
00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:40.516 A:middle
So we use the Accessory Browser.

554
00:29:40.616 --> 00:29:42.396 A:middle
We add the accessories
to the home.

555
00:29:42.936 --> 00:29:45.176 A:middle
The user provides a
name for the accessory.

556
00:29:45.176 --> 00:29:49.956 A:middle
The user chooses
which room to put

557
00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:52.176 A:middle
that accessory in for the home.

558
00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:55.706 A:middle
And after that then the
user can actually go

559
00:29:55.706 --> 00:29:57.686 A:middle
and continue using their
accessory and can interact

560
00:29:57.686 --> 00:29:59.046 A:middle
with it through your
applications,

561
00:29:59.046 --> 00:30:01.306 A:middle
through other applications,
through Siri.

562
00:30:04.616 --> 00:30:11.216 A:middle
So now let's move on to
some more advanced topics.

563
00:30:11.486 --> 00:30:16.656 A:middle
So I've talked a lot about
services and characteristics.

564
00:30:17.326 --> 00:30:21.436 A:middle
And I've talked about
something defined

565
00:30:21.436 --> 00:30:22.706 A:middle
by Apple and then custom ones.

566
00:30:22.706 --> 00:30:27.356 A:middle
So here on the left you can see
a list of services that are some

567
00:30:27.356 --> 00:30:28.666 A:middle
of the services we've defined.

568
00:30:29.006 --> 00:30:31.666 A:middle
And we can see these services
correspond to, kind of broadly,

569
00:30:31.946 --> 00:30:36.976 A:middle
accessory types or functional
groupings of characteristics.

570
00:30:37.806 --> 00:30:40.946 A:middle
Then you see on the
right a sampling of some

571
00:30:40.946 --> 00:30:42.636 A:middle
of the characteristics
that we've defined,

572
00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:45.906 A:middle
and there are many
more of these.

573
00:30:45.906 --> 00:30:52.776 A:middle
And then, as I said earlier, to
encourage innovation, invention,

574
00:30:52.836 --> 00:30:56.666 A:middle
creativity, we allow definition
of any custom service,

575
00:30:56.666 --> 00:31:00.446 A:middle
any custom characteristic an
accessory manufacturer wants

576
00:31:00.446 --> 00:31:00.796 A:middle
to use.

577
00:31:01.056 --> 00:31:03.946 A:middle
Those are all available
to you through HomeKit.

578
00:31:06.646 --> 00:31:10.406 A:middle
And all of these services and
characteristics that are defined

579
00:31:10.446 --> 00:31:15.426 A:middle
by Apple are recognized by
Siri and understood by Siri

580
00:31:16.156 --> 00:31:20.416 A:middle
so that users can interact
with them in very natural ways.

581
00:31:21.996 --> 00:31:23.196 A:middle
Turn something on.

582
00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:25.946 A:middle
Switch something on.

583
00:31:30.056 --> 00:31:34.016 A:middle
There's some other ways that
users, all of us I guess,

584
00:31:34.016 --> 00:31:35.196 A:middle
refer to things in our homes.

585
00:31:35.196 --> 00:31:39.406 A:middle
So groupings of rooms like
upstairs or downstairs

586
00:31:39.636 --> 00:31:40.856 A:middle
or maybe the bedrooms.

587
00:31:42.936 --> 00:31:44.766 A:middle
So rooms can be collected
into zones.

588
00:31:45.246 --> 00:31:47.456 A:middle
It's represented in HMZone

589
00:31:47.456 --> 00:31:50.056 A:middle
and is an arbitrary
grouping of rooms.

590
00:31:50.506 --> 00:31:51.796 A:middle
And this is just an association.

591
00:31:51.796 --> 00:31:53.206 A:middle
It's not an ownership
relationship.

592
00:31:53.716 --> 00:31:56.506 A:middle
So a room can be in
any number of zones.

593
00:31:57.656 --> 00:31:59.316 A:middle
Zones also are uniquely named,

594
00:32:00.096 --> 00:32:01.906 A:middle
and zones are recognized
by Siri.

595
00:32:07.816 --> 00:32:13.176 A:middle
We have another type of
grouping, which is to help group

596
00:32:13.176 --> 00:32:17.676 A:middle
and refer to functionality that
is provided by accessories.

597
00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:20.836 A:middle
We might want to do something
across multiple accessories

598
00:32:20.836 --> 00:32:21.886 A:middle
where you don't necessarily need

599
00:32:21.886 --> 00:32:23.546 A:middle
to control everything
on the accessory.

600
00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:28.096 A:middle
So these are called Service
Groups in HMServiceGroup.

601
00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:33.016 A:middle
So you can imagine you might
have nightlights in your home

602
00:32:33.016 --> 00:32:34.776 A:middle
where some of the nightlights
are their own accessory,

603
00:32:34.776 --> 00:32:37.756 A:middle
but some nightlights are-it's
a light on a coffee machine,

604
00:32:37.756 --> 00:32:38.716 A:middle
it's a light on a microwave,

605
00:32:38.716 --> 00:32:39.986 A:middle
it's a light on the
refrigerator.

606
00:32:39.986 --> 00:32:41.586 A:middle
It's a light on whatever it is.

607
00:32:41.966 --> 00:32:44.366 A:middle
And so you can grab all
of these light services

608
00:32:44.406 --> 00:32:46.466 A:middle
that are actually nightlights,
you can group them together

609
00:32:46.466 --> 00:32:49.236 A:middle
into a Service Group, and
you can easily display

610
00:32:49.236 --> 00:32:49.856 A:middle
that to the user.

611
00:32:49.856 --> 00:32:51.376 A:middle
You can easily perform
operations

612
00:32:51.376 --> 00:32:53.816 A:middle
on all of those nightlights.

613
00:32:55.246 --> 00:32:56.966 A:middle
Services can be in
any number of groups.

614
00:32:56.966 --> 00:32:58.276 A:middle
This is just an association.

615
00:32:58.836 --> 00:33:02.946 A:middle
Service Groups are
also named uniquely

616
00:33:02.946 --> 00:33:03.966 A:middle
of course within a home.

617
00:33:04.896 --> 00:33:07.706 A:middle
And names of Service Groups
are also recognized by Siri.

618
00:33:12.886 --> 00:33:17.126 A:middle
And now getting into
a couple more things

619
00:33:17.126 --> 00:33:18.486 A:middle
that are quite interesting.

620
00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:20.146 A:middle
So first are Action Sets.

621
00:33:21.206 --> 00:33:28.346 A:middle
So this is the HomeKit
implementation behind collecting

622
00:33:28.346 --> 00:33:30.506 A:middle
accessories into scenes.

623
00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:37.056 A:middle
So how this works is we take
a bunch of actions or actions

624
00:33:37.056 --> 00:33:39.586 A:middle
or something you're going
to do to an accessory.

625
00:33:40.826 --> 00:33:42.986 A:middle
And we group those
together into an Action Set.

626
00:33:44.066 --> 00:33:44.986 A:middle
So, for example, night.

627
00:33:44.986 --> 00:33:49.856 A:middle
So we might have a Night
Action Set or a night scene.

628
00:33:50.366 --> 00:33:52.816 A:middle
And so this Night Action Set
might turn off all your lights,

629
00:33:52.816 --> 00:33:53.916 A:middle
lock your door, close
your garage,

630
00:33:53.966 --> 00:33:54.916 A:middle
turn the thermostat down.

631
00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:58.256 A:middle
That could be grouped
together to be easily referred

632
00:33:58.256 --> 00:34:02.346 A:middle
to for the user and
easily execute all at once.

633
00:34:02.546 --> 00:34:05.976 A:middle
And when I say all at once,
I really mean all at once.

634
00:34:06.796 --> 00:34:08.416 A:middle
The order of execution
is undefined.

635
00:34:08.876 --> 00:34:12.156 A:middle
So you can't expect that
something is always going

636
00:34:12.156 --> 00:34:14.706 A:middle
to happen before something
else in an Action Set.

637
00:34:14.706 --> 00:34:16.085 A:middle
Everything will just be
done at the same time.

638
00:34:16.085 --> 00:34:20.716 A:middle
It's all going to get done,
best effort to do everything.

639
00:34:20.985 --> 00:34:25.606 A:middle
Action Sets, again, uniquely
named and recognized by Siri.

640
00:34:26.596 --> 00:34:29.396 A:middle
So what are these actions?

641
00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:35.286 A:middle
So actions are
HMCharacteristicWriteAction.

642
00:34:35.356 --> 00:34:38.076 A:middle
This is a very literal name
because what you're doing

643
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:40.366 A:middle
in an action is you're
writing to a characteristic.

644
00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:48.085 A:middle
So, for example, you may have an
action that is Close the Garage.

645
00:34:48.716 --> 00:34:52.716 A:middle
It's a single write to a single
characteristic on the garage,

646
00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:54.576 A:middle
the garage door opener service.

647
00:34:55.616 --> 00:34:56.716 A:middle
And so that's a single action.

648
00:34:56.716 --> 00:35:02.626 A:middle
So you would create that action,
add it to the Action Set.

649
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:04.016 A:middle
So Action Sets are interesting.

650
00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:06.206 A:middle
They're starting to allow you
to do something more complex.

651
00:35:08.096 --> 00:35:10.716 A:middle
We also have Triggers.

652
00:35:11.536 --> 00:35:13.146 A:middle
So Triggers are HMTimerTrigger.

653
00:35:13.146 --> 00:35:16.796 A:middle
So a Timer Trigger
is set up to fire

654
00:35:16.796 --> 00:35:18.036 A:middle
at a specific date and time.

655
00:35:19.306 --> 00:35:20.206 A:middle
They can repeat.

656
00:35:20.926 --> 00:35:23.076 A:middle
They are uniquely
named within a home,

657
00:35:23.076 --> 00:35:26.896 A:middle
but they are not interacted
with through spoken commands.

658
00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:29.426 A:middle
But they have something
very special about them,

659
00:35:29.976 --> 00:35:33.606 A:middle
which is they are
actually executed by iOS

660
00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:38.996 A:middle
in the background at the time
when that Trigger is supposed

661
00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:41.236 A:middle
to be executed, when it fires.

662
00:35:42.216 --> 00:35:45.626 A:middle
So a Trigger is set
to run an Action Set.

663
00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:53.166 A:middle
And that Action Set
can, the executing

664
00:35:53.166 --> 00:35:57.556 A:middle
of the Action Set can happen
even when no apps are running

665
00:35:57.556 --> 00:36:02.206 A:middle
or whatever because the
Trigger is managed by iOS.

666
00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:11.176 A:middle
So you can imagine that
even with just being able

667
00:36:11.176 --> 00:36:14.696 A:middle
to specify dates and times,
collections of actions

668
00:36:14.696 --> 00:36:17.166 A:middle
to happen, repeating
Triggers, you can start

669
00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:19.026 A:middle
to get some pretty
interesting functionality.

670
00:36:20.126 --> 00:36:22.866 A:middle
So I'd like to give
you a quick demo

671
00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:26.016 A:middle
of how Action Sets
and Triggers work.

672
00:36:27.236 --> 00:36:29.656 A:middle
So we have here our
HomeKit Accessory Simulator

673
00:36:30.256 --> 00:36:30.896 A:middle
still running.

674
00:36:31.716 --> 00:36:38.866 A:middle
And I have another very
simple sample app to show you.

675
00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:42.906 A:middle
Nice and large this time.

676
00:36:44.016 --> 00:36:47.936 A:middle
So here we have in this home
that's in the background,

677
00:36:48.336 --> 00:36:50.756 A:middle
we have some Action Sets and
some Triggers already defined.

678
00:36:51.566 --> 00:36:53.886 A:middle
So if we look at
these Action Sets,

679
00:36:53.886 --> 00:36:57.106 A:middle
we have the Night Action Set,
that example I gave earlier,

680
00:36:57.366 --> 00:37:01.256 A:middle
and we also have a Lights On
and Lights Off Action Set.

681
00:37:02.316 --> 00:37:04.106 A:middle
So if you look at
the Night Action Set,

682
00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:07.886 A:middle
what we've displayed here are
all of the characteristic rights

683
00:37:08.196 --> 00:37:10.506 A:middle
that are part of
this Action Set.

684
00:37:11.576 --> 00:37:15.696 A:middle
And if we go and look at,
for example, some things here

685
00:37:15.696 --> 00:37:19.116 A:middle
so the, thermostat's
target temperature,

686
00:37:19.116 --> 00:37:21.356 A:middle
let's say that was set at 70.

687
00:37:22.376 --> 00:37:30.056 A:middle
We can go here and unlock
the door, for example,

688
00:37:30.056 --> 00:37:32.756 A:middle
and then we can go here in this
Action Set, and you can see

689
00:37:32.756 --> 00:37:34.196 A:middle
that the door lock is going

690
00:37:34.196 --> 00:37:37.766 A:middle
to have the lock
characteristic set to Locked.

691
00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:40.806 A:middle
The thermostat is going to
have the target temperature set

692
00:37:40.806 --> 00:37:41.886 A:middle
to 68.

693
00:37:41.886 --> 00:37:44.116 A:middle
So I can execute this
Action Set, and we can see

694
00:37:44.116 --> 00:37:47.206 A:middle
that the lock has
indeed changed to Locked.

695
00:37:47.206 --> 00:37:50.166 A:middle
Thermostat target temperature
has changed back to 68.

696
00:37:50.756 --> 00:37:54.056 A:middle
And these lights are off.

697
00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:58.086 A:middle
So simple way, once it's all
set up, very simple way to go

698
00:37:58.086 --> 00:38:02.016 A:middle
and control many
accessories at the same time.

699
00:38:03.056 --> 00:38:05.986 A:middle
So now let's look
at these other two.

700
00:38:05.986 --> 00:38:06.586 A:middle
So Lights On.

701
00:38:07.136 --> 00:38:11.596 A:middle
It simply turns on
all the lights.

702
00:38:12.036 --> 00:38:15.806 A:middle
And Lights Off obviously, right,
it just turns off the lights.

703
00:38:16.416 --> 00:38:19.466 A:middle
So these two Action Sets
just give me the opportunity

704
00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:22.346 A:middle
to show you a very simple
demo of how Triggers work.

705
00:38:22.346 --> 00:38:24.686 A:middle
So we have here two
Triggers that are created.

706
00:38:25.026 --> 00:38:27.146 A:middle
One runs the Action
Set Lights On,

707
00:38:27.366 --> 00:38:30.536 A:middle
and one runs the
Action Set Lights Off.

708
00:38:30.536 --> 00:38:34.196 A:middle
And we can see that when I've
turned these Triggers on,

709
00:38:34.196 --> 00:38:37.536 A:middle
I've enabled them, that these
lights just start blinking.

710
00:38:39.036 --> 00:38:43.086 A:middle
Probably not a commonly used
use case in the real world,

711
00:38:43.086 --> 00:38:45.786 A:middle
but a great example for a demo.

712
00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:48.366 A:middle
So let's stop that.

713
00:38:48.366 --> 00:38:51.756 A:middle
That's Triggers and Action Sets.

714
00:38:52.816 --> 00:38:56.696 A:middle
Let's go back to the slides.

715
00:38:59.396 --> 00:39:02.066 A:middle
So using Action Sets
and Triggers together,
