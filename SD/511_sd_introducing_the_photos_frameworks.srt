[ Silence ]

2
00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:12.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

3
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:12.976 A:middle
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:15.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

5
00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:17.916 A:middle
Welcome to Session 511.

6
00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:20.356 A:middle
This is the Introduction
to the Photos Frameworks,

7
00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:22.206 A:middle
collectively known as PhotoKit.

8
00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.846 A:middle
And my name is Adam Swift.

9
00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:26.106 A:middle
No jokes, please.

10
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.066 A:middle
I'm a software engineer on the
iOS Photos Frameworks Team.

11
00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:33.046 A:middle
All right.

12
00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.446 A:middle
So, we're really excited

13
00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:37.616 A:middle
about introducing you
to PhotoKit today.

14
00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:40.606 A:middle
PhotoKit is comprised
of two frameworks.

15
00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.736 A:middle
The first framework is
the Photos Framework

16
00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:46.716 A:middle
which gives you access
to the photos and videos

17
00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:48.656 A:middle
from the user's photo library.

18
00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.066 A:middle
And you can use it to
build a full-featured app

19
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.196 A:middle
like the built-in
Photos application.

20
00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:57.836 A:middle
The second framework is
the Photos UI framework,

21
00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.316 A:middle
and this is a framework
that will allow you

22
00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:03.646 A:middle
to build a photo editing
extension, app extension,

23
00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:06.726 A:middle
that can be used right within
the built-in Photos app.

24
00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.966 A:middle
So, in this session we're
going to focus first

25
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:17.196 A:middle
on how you can use the
Photos Framework to fetch

26
00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:19.146 A:middle
and manipulate photo
library model data,

27
00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:23.786 A:middle
handle external changes, and
both retrieve and edit photo

28
00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.806 A:middle
and video content in
the iOS 8 photo library.

29
00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:29.706 A:middle
Then we're going to
turn our attention

30
00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:33.596 A:middle
to the PhotosUI Framework and
walk you through the steps

31
00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:36.296 A:middle
and the concepts you need
to understand in order

32
00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.566 A:middle
to build your own app extension

33
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.546 A:middle
for editing photo
and video content.

34
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.726 A:middle
All right.

35
00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:46.146 A:middle
So, let's get started
with the Photos Framework.

36
00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:53.406 A:middle
The Photos Framework is a new
Objective-C framework in iOS 8.

37
00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:59.366 A:middle
And it allows you to make
your application a first-class

38
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.736 A:middle
citizen of the system photo
library for everything

39
00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:06.126 A:middle
from something simple
like a custom image picker

40
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.026 A:middle
in your application to going

41
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:11.846 A:middle
and building a full-featured
custom application

42
00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:14.286 A:middle
for browsing the photo
library and editing.

43
00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:19.096 A:middle
And we really believe in this

44
00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:22.746 A:middle
because we're using the Photos
Framework in our own Photos

45
00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.456 A:middle
and Camera applications
that are built in in iOS 8.

46
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:29.036 A:middle
For those of you who have
worked with photos in the past,

47
00:02:29.726 --> 00:02:31.546 A:middle
this Photos Framework
is designed

48
00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:34.756 A:middle
to supersede the ALAssetsLibrary
which doesn't provide,

49
00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:41.096 A:middle
[ Laughter and Applause ]

50
00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:44.126 A:middle
which doesn't provide much of
the functionality and features

51
00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:45.616 A:middle
that you'll get with
the Photos Framework.

52
00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:50.626 A:middle
So what do you get with
the Photos Framework?

53
00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:53.646 A:middle
You get access to photo
and video assets, albums,

54
00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.126 A:middle
and moments, something
you didn't get

55
00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:57.116 A:middle
with the assets library.

56
00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:03.976 A:middle
And then you can also
add, remove, modify assets

57
00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:06.596 A:middle
and albums right in the
system-wide photo library.

58
00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:12.336 A:middle
You can then also edit photo
and video content and metadata

59
00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:15.706 A:middle
that is written directly into
the system photo library.

60
00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:19.086 A:middle
We're excited about it, too.

61
00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:19.696 A:middle
That's okay.

62
00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:24.856 A:middle
So, we're going to walk through
this API in a couple of steps.

63
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:27.746 A:middle
The first section is going
to focus on the model data

64
00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:30.486 A:middle
and this is going to
walk you through how

65
00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:33.746 A:middle
to fetch the model objects,
how to change model data,

66
00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:35.876 A:middle
how to handle external changes.

67
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.576 A:middle
And then we'll turn our
attention to working

68
00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:41.816 A:middle
with the image and video
content of those assets,

69
00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:46.266 A:middle
how to retrieve it efficiently,
and tips for working

70
00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:49.646 A:middle
with different types of image
and video content, and then how

71
00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.226 A:middle
to go ahead and make changes

72
00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:53.556 A:middle
and apply those back
to the photo library.

73
00:03:54.246 --> 00:03:57.716 A:middle
So I'm going to start off
looking at Model Data.

74
00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:01.736 A:middle
So, Model Data in the Photos
Framework is represented

75
00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.586 A:middle
with what we call model objects.

76
00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:07.006 A:middle
And these represent the
structure of the photo library.

77
00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:10.196 A:middle
These are the records
that represent photo

78
00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:13.756 A:middle
and video assets, moments,
albums, and folders.

79
00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:19.086 A:middle
And the key concept I want you
to take away from this section,

80
00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:23.556 A:middle
one of the key concepts is that
Model Objects that are presented

81
00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:28.746 A:middle
in the Photo Framework are read
only, and that is a nice benefit

82
00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:31.036 A:middle
because it means you can
work with those objects

83
00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:32.246 A:middle
in a thread-safe manner.

84
00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:34.616 A:middle
You can pass them between
threads without worrying

85
00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.656 A:middle
about their data changing
out from underneath you.

86
00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:42.086 A:middle
There's no worries about locking
and handling concurrent changes.

87
00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:47.176 A:middle
So I'd like to walk through
the different Model Objects

88
00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:50.876 A:middle
that we provide with an
illustration using the built-in

89
00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:52.576 A:middle
iOS 8 Photos Application.

90
00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.446 A:middle
So we'll start with the assets.

91
00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.106 A:middle
These are the photos and videos

92
00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.926 A:middle
that you see here
in the Photos App.

93
00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:04.546 A:middle
And then containing assets
we have at the next level up,

94
00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:07.846 A:middle
Asset Collections, what
we call Asset Collections

95
00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:08.756 A:middle
in the Photos Framework.

96
00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:13.236 A:middle
And in the case we're looking
at a view that shows moments.

97
00:05:13.236 --> 00:05:16.126 A:middle
And a moment is comprised
of a collection of assets.

98
00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:20.496 A:middle
At the next level above that,

99
00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:23.566 A:middle
we have what we call
Collection Lists,

100
00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:26.196 A:middle
and these are lists
of Asset Collections.

101
00:05:26.606 --> 00:05:28.236 A:middle
And in the case you're
looking at here,

102
00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:31.526 A:middle
we're seeing the year/moment
view which is comprised

103
00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:33.236 A:middle
of a series of moments
which then

104
00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:35.796 A:middle
in turn are comprised of assets.

105
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:41.416 A:middle
Now let's walk through
these Model Objects in terms

106
00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.076 A:middle
of the APIs that
are exposed to you

107
00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.146 A:middle
through the Photos Framework.

108
00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:46.676 A:middle
The first one we'll
look at is the Assets,

109
00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:47.686 A:middle
the photos and videos.

110
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:51.016 A:middle
And photos and videos
assets are represented

111
00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:52.696 A:middle
by the PHAsset class.

112
00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:57.236 A:middle
And as you look through this
UI in the Photos Application,

113
00:05:57.236 --> 00:05:59.266 A:middle
you can see it's a photo.

114
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:00.266 A:middle
That's the media type.

115
00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:02.286 A:middle
But then at the top

116
00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:05.096 A:middle
of the screen you can see we're
displaying the creation date

117
00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.116 A:middle
and the location, which are
both properties of the asset.

118
00:06:09.106 --> 00:06:11.966 A:middle
Down at the bottom of the screen
you can see an icon representing

119
00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:14.796 A:middle
a heart that is -- whether

120
00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:16.766 A:middle
that asset has been
marked as a favorite.

121
00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:19.436 A:middle
And these are all
properties available to you

122
00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:21.296 A:middle
in the Model Object, PHAsset.

123
00:06:21.726 --> 00:06:25.756 A:middle
At the next level
up we're talking

124
00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:27.586 A:middle
about the Asset Collection
and, again,

125
00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.466 A:middle
we're illustrating
that with the moment.

126
00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:34.176 A:middle
An Asset Collection is a general
ordered collection of assets,

127
00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:35.596 A:middle
so there are a couple
of different types.

128
00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:37.706 A:middle
We've got moments,
like you can see here.

129
00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:40.266 A:middle
But we also have
albums and smart albums.

130
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:44.246 A:middle
The Asset Collection,
unsurprisingly,

131
00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:47.676 A:middle
represented by the
PHAssetCollection class,

132
00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:50.916 A:middle
and it has the properties
of the type, title,

133
00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:52.566 A:middle
and start and end date.

134
00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:54.676 A:middle
And you can see these
properties reflected in the UI.

135
00:06:56.816 --> 00:07:00.606 A:middle
Going one level higher, we
have the Collection List.

136
00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:04.556 A:middle
And a Collection List
is an ordered collection

137
00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:05.456 A:middle
of collections.

138
00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:08.776 A:middle
And in the case we're looking at
here, we've got a moment year.

139
00:07:09.316 --> 00:07:11.086 A:middle
But you can also have
a Collection List

140
00:07:11.086 --> 00:07:12.556 A:middle
that represents a folder.

141
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.426 A:middle
And something that's
unique about a folder

142
00:07:15.426 --> 00:07:19.026 A:middle
versus a moment year type
of Collection List is

143
00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:21.796 A:middle
that a folder can
actually contain subfolders

144
00:07:21.946 --> 00:07:23.276 A:middle
as well as albums.

145
00:07:23.436 --> 00:07:27.486 A:middle
So that's why we say an ordered
collection of collections

146
00:07:27.486 --> 00:07:30.316 A:middle
where those collections
might be an Asset Collection

147
00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:32.716 A:middle
or a Collection List.

148
00:07:33.316 --> 00:07:38.666 A:middle
The Collection List class is
the PHCollectionList and similar

149
00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:41.216 A:middle
to the Asset Collection
has a type, title,

150
00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:44.916 A:middle
and a start and end date.

151
00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:48.306 A:middle
So when you want to work
with these Model Objects,

152
00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.726 A:middle
you need to get them out
of the photo library.

153
00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:55.466 A:middle
So, in order to get
these Model Objects

154
00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:58.576 A:middle
out of the photo library, the
key concept here that I want you

155
00:07:58.656 --> 00:08:00.626 A:middle
to focus on in this
section for fetching,

156
00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:05.236 A:middle
is that you use the class
methods on the Model Object

157
00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.256 A:middle
that you want to fetch out.

158
00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:08.696 A:middle
So when you want to
fetch out assets --

159
00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.766 A:middle
say you wanted to fetch
all of the video assets --

160
00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:14.536 A:middle
you look for the class
method on the PHAsset class,

161
00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:20.486 A:middle
fetchAssetsWithMediaType,
specifying the media type video.

162
00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.986 A:middle
Similarly, as I said before,

163
00:08:22.986 --> 00:08:24.906 A:middle
a moment is a type
of Asset Collection.

164
00:08:25.236 --> 00:08:28.446 A:middle
So to fetch moments
we use a class method

165
00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:32.576 A:middle
on the Asset Collection class
to fetchMomentsWithOptions.

166
00:08:33.476 --> 00:08:36.635 A:middle
Now in both of these examples
I've omitted the options,

167
00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:39.856 A:middle
but they give you an opportunity
to do things like filter

168
00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:42.446 A:middle
or sort the results
that you get back.

169
00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:48.496 A:middle
So the next key concept
I want to cover as far

170
00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:52.326 A:middle
as collections are
concerned is that collections

171
00:08:52.426 --> 00:08:56.776 A:middle
in the Photos Framework runtime
don't actually cache their

172
00:08:56.776 --> 00:08:59.526 A:middle
contents, excuse me.

173
00:08:59.796 --> 00:09:03.016 A:middle
So what that means is that
in order to find the assets

174
00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:06.266 A:middle
that live in an album you need
to perform a fetch similar

175
00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:08.916 A:middle
to the ones that we just saw
for general purpose fetching.

176
00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:10.886 A:middle
So here's an illustration
of that.

177
00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:13.656 A:middle
To fetch the assets in an
Asset Collection represented

178
00:09:13.656 --> 00:09:17.786 A:middle
by an album, we're getting back
assets, so we use a class method

179
00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:21.156 A:middle
on the PHAsset class
and fetch assets in the

180
00:09:21.156 --> 00:09:22.776 A:middle
in the AssetCollectionmyAlbum.

181
00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:27.526 A:middle
Now the next construct
that I want

182
00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:31.406 A:middle
to cover here is something we
call a Transient Collection.

183
00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:36.376 A:middle
And this is a really useful
construct that we've made a lot

184
00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:40.146 A:middle
of use of in the photos
application where we wanted

185
00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:43.636 A:middle
to represent a collection
that isn't represented

186
00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:45.146 A:middle
in the actual photo library.

187
00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:49.316 A:middle
An example of that is a search
result or a user selection

188
00:09:49.316 --> 00:09:51.266 A:middle
as they're picking
off items in the UI.

189
00:09:52.196 --> 00:09:57.966 A:middle
And by taking that selection
of items or model objects

190
00:09:57.966 --> 00:09:59.816 A:middle
and putting it into a
Transient Collection,

191
00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:04.926 A:middle
the benefit is the Transient
Collection is interchangeable

192
00:10:04.986 --> 00:10:07.146 A:middle
with the regular collections
that you might fetch

193
00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:07.976 A:middle
out of the photo library.

194
00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:12.376 A:middle
So you can do things like reuse
your existing view controllers

195
00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:14.846 A:middle
or fetch the contents of
a Transient Collection

196
00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:17.496 A:middle
without worrying about whether
it's represented by something

197
00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:20.186 A:middle
that really exists
on the photo library

198
00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:21.306 A:middle
or if it's just something

199
00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:23.106 A:middle
that your user is working
with in the runtime.

200
00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:27.726 A:middle
To create a Transient Collection
there's a class method

201
00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.236 A:middle
on the Asset Collection class

202
00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:30.896 A:middle
to create a Transient
Asset Collection.

203
00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:33.066 A:middle
You could also create a
Transient Collection list.

204
00:10:33.606 --> 00:10:35.576 A:middle
But to create a Transient
Asset Collection we call

205
00:10:35.576 --> 00:10:37.636 A:middle
transientAsset
CollectionWithAssets

206
00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:40.246 A:middle
and simply pass in
an array of assets

207
00:10:40.586 --> 00:10:41.746 A:middle
as well as an optional title.

208
00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:48.526 A:middle
So what are you getting back
when you perform these fetches?

209
00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:51.386 A:middle
Most of the time when you're
writing an application to work

210
00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.846 A:middle
with photos, you're going
to be reading those objects,

211
00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:56.076 A:middle
looking through them,
working with them.

212
00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:58.266 A:middle
So we wanted to make it
as simple as possible

213
00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:00.696 A:middle
to get those objects out and
to work with them directly.

214
00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:03.016 A:middle
So you wanted to get
synchronous results

215
00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:04.086 A:middle
and you want them quickly.

216
00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:09.056 A:middle
But, especially when you think
about iCloud Photo Library,

217
00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:12.996 A:middle
the results of the fetch could
be potentially very large,

218
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.536 A:middle
in the tens of thousands
of assets or even more.

219
00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:17.886 A:middle
So it's really important

220
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.316 A:middle
that you don't fetch all those
objects into memory at once.

221
00:11:20.976 --> 00:11:23.466 A:middle
And you really want to
work with them in batches

222
00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:25.956 A:middle
as you're working with them
or displaying them on screen.

223
00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:29.166 A:middle
But we didn't want to put
that complexity on you.

224
00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:33.486 A:middle
So what we did is we've
introduced a class

225
00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:35.266 A:middle
to represent the
objects that you get back

226
00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:37.466 A:middle
from a fetch called
a PHFetchResult.

227
00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:43.296 A:middle
And the PHFetchResult takes care
of tracking the full results set

228
00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:44.316 A:middle
by keeping track

229
00:11:44.316 --> 00:11:46.856 A:middle
of the lightweight
IDs representing each

230
00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:48.536 A:middle
of the contents of that fetch.

231
00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:52.776 A:middle
But when you access the contents
of that fetch result to pull one

232
00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:55.776 A:middle
of the objects out, we'll vend
you a fully realized object

233
00:11:56.086 --> 00:11:56.896 A:middle
that you can work with.

234
00:11:57.896 --> 00:12:00.906 A:middle
It's got an API that's familiar
and similar to the NSArray

235
00:12:00.906 --> 00:12:03.406 A:middle
so it should be easy
to work with.

236
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:07.896 A:middle
And I'd like to show you
an example of what it looks

237
00:12:07.896 --> 00:12:10.426 A:middle
like as you're working
with a fetch result.

238
00:12:11.406 --> 00:12:16.146 A:middle
So on the slide here I've
shown a fetch result that's

239
00:12:16.146 --> 00:12:18.416 A:middle
representing, say, a
fetch of 10,000 assets

240
00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:21.706 A:middle
and as we're iterating
through that result set,

241
00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:26.666 A:middle
pulling out assets, as we
access one of the indexes,

242
00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:29.916 A:middle
we'll behind the scenes pull
in a full batch to represent

243
00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.026 A:middle
that object as well
as many of the others.

244
00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:36.696 A:middle
And as you iterate through over
that batch to the next batch,

245
00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:38.976 A:middle
we'll pull in the
next batch of objects

246
00:12:39.246 --> 00:12:41.976 A:middle
but release the previous
ones so you don't wind

247
00:12:41.976 --> 00:12:43.266 A:middle
up holding onto all that memory.

248
00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:48.806 A:middle
So now that you've got the
[applause] -- ah, thanks.

249
00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:53.656 A:middle
Now that you've got Model
Objects that you're working

250
00:12:53.656 --> 00:12:58.736 A:middle
with in your application, your
user may, will, oftentimes want

251
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.206 A:middle
to make changes to
those objects.

252
00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:03.786 A:middle
So I want to take a look at
how you can make Model changes

253
00:13:04.426 --> 00:13:07.176 A:middle
with those Model
Objects to support things

254
00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:11.516 A:middle
like the user wanting to
favorite a photo or add a photo

255
00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:15.056 A:middle
to an album because,
as I said earlier,

256
00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:17.156 A:middle
the Model Objects
themselves are read only

257
00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:18.666 A:middle
so you can't mutate
them directly.

258
00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.786 A:middle
So the way we express changes is

259
00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:25.346 A:middle
through a Change
Request API that's based

260
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:30.056 A:middle
on change request
classes that you create

261
00:13:30.056 --> 00:13:33.376 A:middle
in a change request block and
then hand to the photo library

262
00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:36.736 A:middle
so that it can apply those
changes asynchronously

263
00:13:36.896 --> 00:13:37.856 A:middle
out of process.

264
00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:41.196 A:middle
And the reasons those changes
are applied out of process

265
00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:43.286 A:middle
and asynchronously is twofold.

266
00:13:44.096 --> 00:13:49.006 A:middle
The first reason is for some
operations it may be very

267
00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:52.736 A:middle
expensive or processor intensive
or just take a long time.

268
00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:56.296 A:middle
But even more importantly than
that, because you're working

269
00:13:56.296 --> 00:13:59.086 A:middle
with the user's actual
photo library some

270
00:13:59.086 --> 00:14:02.406 A:middle
of those actions may
require user authentication.

271
00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:05.066 A:middle
For example, if you
wanted to delete 10 photos,

272
00:14:06.276 --> 00:14:08.626 A:middle
the photo library's going
to prompt the user to say,

273
00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:13.406 A:middle
"Is this application allowed
to delete these 10 photos,"

274
00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:17.636 A:middle
to allow the user to have
a chance to confirm that.

275
00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:21.426 A:middle
So let's take a look at
the change request classes.

276
00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:22.796 A:middle
It's actually pretty simple.

277
00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:26.416 A:middle
For each model object class
there is a change request class.

278
00:14:26.416 --> 00:14:28.036 A:middle
We've got the
AssetChangeRequest,

279
00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.466 A:middle
the
AssetCollectionChangeRequest,

280
00:14:29.816 --> 00:14:32.016 A:middle
and the
CollectionListChangeRequest.

281
00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:35.796 A:middle
And each of these change
request classes provide model

282
00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:38.966 A:middle
object-specific APIs to allow
you to perform the types

283
00:14:38.966 --> 00:14:40.116 A:middle
of changes that they allow.

284
00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:45.716 A:middle
So the example I'm showing here
is for the asset change request

285
00:14:45.716 --> 00:14:48.126 A:middle
where you can set the
creation date for an asset

286
00:14:48.436 --> 00:14:49.646 A:middle
or to set it as a favorite.

287
00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:55.936 A:middle
Some other things to understand

288
00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:57.356 A:middle
about the change
request classes is

289
00:14:57.356 --> 00:15:00.556 A:middle
that they are not subclasses
of the model classes.

290
00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:02.396 A:middle
And there's a good
reason for that.

291
00:15:02.626 --> 00:15:05.016 A:middle
We wanted to provide a
really clear separation

292
00:15:05.016 --> 00:15:08.436 A:middle
between the thread-safe,
immutable model objects

293
00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:10.496 A:middle
and the objects that
express mutations.

294
00:15:10.796 --> 00:15:12.266 A:middle
That's the change
request classes.

295
00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:15.726 A:middle
These change request classes
are also only valid to work

296
00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:17.616 A:middle
with in a change request block.

297
00:15:18.086 --> 00:15:22.546 A:middle
So I'd like to illustrate
that with an example now.

298
00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:29.436 A:middle
So here's an example where I've
provided a sample implementation

299
00:15:29.436 --> 00:15:33.856 A:middle
of a method to toggle whether
an asset has been marked

300
00:15:33.856 --> 00:15:34.436 A:middle
as a favorite.

301
00:15:35.586 --> 00:15:37.226 A:middle
So the first thing we'll do

302
00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:41.526 A:middle
in this method is ask
the shared photo library

303
00:15:41.526 --> 00:15:43.776 A:middle
to perform some changes,
and we'll pass

304
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.276 A:middle
in a change request block here.

305
00:15:47.776 --> 00:15:51.336 A:middle
First step in that block is
to create a change request

306
00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:53.516 A:middle
for the asset that we were
provided in the method.

307
00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:57.026 A:middle
And we're using the
PHAssetChangeRequest class here

308
00:15:57.026 --> 00:15:57.556 A:middle
you can see.

309
00:15:58.126 --> 00:16:03.236 A:middle
And then the last
step is simply to set

310
00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:08.466 A:middle
on the change request the value
of Favorite to the inverse value

311
00:16:08.466 --> 00:16:11.036 A:middle
of what the asset currently has.

312
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:16.446 A:middle
That's enough for the block to
get passed to the photo library

313
00:16:16.836 --> 00:16:19.366 A:middle
and those changes to be
performed on your behalf.

314
00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:23.626 A:middle
After those changes are
performed we'll call back the

315
00:16:23.626 --> 00:16:28.206 A:middle
completion handler and let
you know if it was successful

316
00:16:28.546 --> 00:16:29.756 A:middle
in performing those changes.

317
00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:36.296 A:middle
So one other aspect of
working with change requests

318
00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:40.276 A:middle
that you'll want to do is
to create new Model Objects.

319
00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:42.526 A:middle
And you can create
new Model Objects

320
00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:44.466 A:middle
with these same change
request classes

321
00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:45.866 A:middle
but creating a different kind

322
00:16:45.866 --> 00:16:49.056 A:middle
of change request using
a creation request.

323
00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:50.886 A:middle
So in this case I've
shown as an example

324
00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:53.106 A:middle
where you can create a new asset

325
00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:56.966 A:middle
from an image using the
creationRequestForAssetFromImage

326
00:16:57.256 --> 00:16:57.946 A:middle
class method.

327
00:16:59.246 --> 00:17:02.316 A:middle
And if all you want to
do is create a new asset

328
00:17:02.316 --> 00:17:04.955 A:middle
from an image, you're done.

329
00:17:04.955 --> 00:17:08.156 A:middle
You just make this call
within a change request block

330
00:17:08.156 --> 00:17:10.406 A:middle
and the library will take
care of adding the asset.

331
00:17:11.506 --> 00:17:13.996 A:middle
But if you want to
work with that asset

332
00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:17.896 A:middle
within that change request block
to do some additional work, say,

333
00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:21.455 A:middle
to add it to an album, well,

334
00:17:21.455 --> 00:17:24.566 A:middle
remember that the asset
won't actually be created

335
00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:26.665 A:middle
until the work is
performed out of process.

336
00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:32.566 A:middle
So within the same change
request block you can access a

337
00:17:32.566 --> 00:17:35.736 A:middle
placeholder object from the
change request representing

338
00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:37.286 A:middle
that new unsaved object.

339
00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:40.986 A:middle
And then you can use that
placeholder to add the new asset

340
00:17:40.986 --> 00:17:45.396 A:middle
to a collection or even
potentially a new placeholder

341
00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:46.166 A:middle
for a collection.

342
00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:49.306 A:middle
One other thing you can get

343
00:17:49.306 --> 00:17:52.836 A:middle
from a placeholder object is you
can access the localIdentifier

344
00:17:52.836 --> 00:17:55.886 A:middle
which is a unique string
that you can use later

345
00:17:55.886 --> 00:17:58.766 A:middle
in your application to
fetch that object back even

346
00:17:58.766 --> 00:17:59.886 A:middle
on another invocation.

347
00:18:01.736 --> 00:18:04.096 A:middle
So what happens to
these changes?

348
00:18:05.766 --> 00:18:07.446 A:middle
Well, the changes are done

349
00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:09.106 A:middle
when the completion
handler is invoked.

350
00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:12.466 A:middle
But the Model Objects
are read only

351
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:14.806 A:middle
and they aren't automatically
refreshed or modified

352
00:18:14.806 --> 00:18:15.776 A:middle
out from underneath you.

353
00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:19.336 A:middle
But more important than these
two things when we're talking

354
00:18:19.336 --> 00:18:22.466 A:middle
about changes, there's a really
important thing to understand.

355
00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:26.906 A:middle
The changes that you requested
may incur side effects

356
00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:31.406 A:middle
or may be influenced by
external changes coming

357
00:18:31.406 --> 00:18:32.126 A:middle
in from elsewhere.

358
00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:35.766 A:middle
In fact, there are a lot
of sources for change

359
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:36.946 A:middle
into the photo library.

360
00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.526 A:middle
There's your application.

361
00:18:38.626 --> 00:18:40.066 A:middle
There's the built-in
application.

362
00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:41.766 A:middle
There's iCloud Photo Library,

363
00:18:42.036 --> 00:18:44.416 A:middle
Cloud Photo Sharing,
and my Photo Stream.

364
00:18:44.926 --> 00:18:47.366 A:middle
And all of these things can
have an impact on the data

365
00:18:47.366 --> 00:18:48.176 A:middle
that you're working with.

366
00:18:48.926 --> 00:18:51.816 A:middle
So what we recommend is
that instead of trying

367
00:18:51.816 --> 00:18:54.676 A:middle
to take the result of a change
in your completion handler,

368
00:18:55.316 --> 00:18:58.406 A:middle
you work with a single
change notification system

369
00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:00.566 A:middle
to handle changes
there and reflect them

370
00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:03.606 A:middle
to your user that way.

371
00:19:03.796 --> 00:19:06.556 A:middle
So what happens is,
anytime there is a change

372
00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:09.646 A:middle
to the photo library,
we'll publish a PHChange

373
00:19:09.686 --> 00:19:11.556 A:middle
to registered observers.

374
00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:14.866 A:middle
And that change is delivered
on a background queue

375
00:19:15.296 --> 00:19:18.596 A:middle
and it provides details on
updated and deleted objects.

376
00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:22.276 A:middle
But where it begins to
get really powerful is

377
00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:23.866 A:middle
when you're working
with fetch results

378
00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:27.566 A:middle
where it can provide you
details on what indexes

379
00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:29.856 A:middle
and objects were
inserted, updated, deleted,

380
00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:32.216 A:middle
or moved that apply
to that fetch result.

381
00:19:33.516 --> 00:19:34.766 A:middle
And I want to dig
a little deeper

382
00:19:34.766 --> 00:19:36.976 A:middle
into the fetch result
change details.

383
00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:40.476 A:middle
When you create a fetch
result by performing a fetch

384
00:19:40.476 --> 00:19:42.726 A:middle
for a collection or any
other general purpose fetch,

385
00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:45.906 A:middle
the fetch result will
implicitly register itself

386
00:19:46.146 --> 00:19:48.936 A:middle
with the photo library
for calculating changes.

387
00:19:49.816 --> 00:19:53.576 A:middle
And all those changed details
are calculated in the background

388
00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:57.066 A:middle
so they don't run while
your user is interacting

389
00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:57.926 A:middle
with your application.

390
00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:03.456 A:middle
If you're fetching a fetch
result and you're not interested

391
00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:05.486 A:middle
in change details, you can opt

392
00:20:05.486 --> 00:20:08.796 A:middle
out of the difference
calculation via one

393
00:20:08.796 --> 00:20:09.726 A:middle
of those fetch options.

394
00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:13.296 A:middle
But if you do want the details,

395
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:18.046 A:middle
if you want those incremental
differences, then it's important

396
00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:21.636 A:middle
that you get the updated fetch
result for the fetch result

397
00:20:21.636 --> 00:20:26.746 A:middle
that you started with from
the PHFetchResultChangeDetails

398
00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:27.336 A:middle
object.

399
00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:29.626 A:middle
And I'm going to walk
you through an example

400
00:20:29.626 --> 00:20:31.816 A:middle
to demonstrate why
that's so important.

401
00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:36.166 A:middle
When the photo library
receives a change,

402
00:20:36.726 --> 00:20:39.016 A:middle
if you've registered
yourself as an observer,

403
00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:41.396 A:middle
we'll call the
PhotoLibraryDidChange method

404
00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:43.376 A:middle
and pass you the
PHChange instance.

405
00:20:43.916 --> 00:20:48.326 A:middle
In this case, in this
example, which by the way,

406
00:20:48.326 --> 00:20:50.896 A:middle
this example is taken from the
sample code that's provided

407
00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:53.996 A:middle
with this session, so I've
omitted some of the details

408
00:20:53.996 --> 00:20:55.796 A:middle
to make it a little
clearer on stage,

409
00:20:56.236 --> 00:20:58.666 A:middle
but all of this is
available in the sample code

410
00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:02.336 A:middle
that you can download
from the DC website.

411
00:21:03.476 --> 00:21:05.646 A:middle
Anyway, getting back to that.

412
00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:08.086 A:middle
The first thing we're
going to want to do

413
00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:12.816 A:middle
in our change handler here is
to dispatch to the main queue.

414
00:21:12.816 --> 00:21:14.966 A:middle
And the reason for that is
because we're going to work

415
00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:17.796 A:middle
with our user interface
objects, our view controllers,

416
00:21:18.086 --> 00:21:20.976 A:middle
and you know it's only safe to
access those on the main queue.

417
00:21:22.556 --> 00:21:24.576 A:middle
So once we've dispatched

418
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:27.316 A:middle
to the main queue we'll
ask the change instance,

419
00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:30.826 A:middle
were there any changed
details for the fetch result

420
00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:32.886 A:middle
that we are working with
in our view controller?

421
00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:36.496 A:middle
And in this case, we've got --
I've represented self.assets.

422
00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:41.646 A:middle
That's a fetch result that we're
presenting in a collection view.

423
00:21:42.726 --> 00:21:46.056 A:middle
So if there's a change that
affects the collection view,

424
00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.336 A:middle
the contents of that
collection view,

425
00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:48.876 A:middle
we want to know what
those details are.

426
00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:51.226 A:middle
So we'll ask the change instance
for those change details.

427
00:21:51.746 --> 00:21:55.666 A:middle
And if there were any change
details then we know we need

428
00:21:55.666 --> 00:22:00.196 A:middle
to update our fetch result based
on what those changes were.

429
00:22:00.536 --> 00:22:02.346 A:middle
And the way to get
those details,

430
00:22:02.346 --> 00:22:04.656 A:middle
or to get that updated fetch
result as I was saying,

431
00:22:04.916 --> 00:22:07.806 A:middle
is to get it directly from
the change details object.

432
00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:10.826 A:middle
The change details have
already done that work for us,

433
00:22:11.016 --> 00:22:13.856 A:middle
and that way we're sure that the
other details we're going to ask

434
00:22:13.856 --> 00:22:16.096 A:middle
for about inserts, updates,
and deletes are going

435
00:22:16.096 --> 00:22:19.166 A:middle
to exactly match up to the new
result that we're working with.

436
00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:22.676 A:middle
So on the second
slide here I'm going

437
00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:26.056 A:middle
to show you how nicely
this works with an object

438
00:22:26.056 --> 00:22:26.996 A:middle
like the collectionView.

439
00:22:27.786 --> 00:22:29.446 A:middle
So now we can tell
the collectionView

440
00:22:29.946 --> 00:22:32.716 A:middle
to perform a batch
of updates and walk

441
00:22:32.716 --> 00:22:36.376 A:middle
through the changed details to
see where there removed indexes?

442
00:22:36.596 --> 00:22:39.016 A:middle
If there were, we'll
translate them into index paths

443
00:22:39.016 --> 00:22:41.256 A:middle
that the collectionView
can understand and tell it

444
00:22:41.256 --> 00:22:44.796 A:middle
to delete the items
at those paths.

445
00:22:44.966 --> 00:22:46.986 A:middle
Similarly, we'll ask
the change details,

446
00:22:46.986 --> 00:22:49.186 A:middle
were there inserted indexes
in that fetch result?

447
00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:51.936 A:middle
If there were, we'll tell
the collectionView again

448
00:22:52.296 --> 00:22:55.546 A:middle
to insert items at those paths.

449
00:22:55.546 --> 00:22:59.146 A:middle
And same with changed indexes
that affect the fetch results.

450
00:22:59.486 --> 00:23:01.876 A:middle
We'll ask the collectionVew
to reload those items.

451
00:23:03.106 --> 00:23:06.796 A:middle
So now I'd like to take a moment
to show you a demonstration

452
00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:10.706 A:middle
of the sample code that we've
provided with this session.

453
00:23:11.476 --> 00:23:12.536 A:middle
So the first thing I'm going

454
00:23:12.536 --> 00:23:16.876 A:middle
to do before I actually run the
sample app is just give you a

455
00:23:16.876 --> 00:23:19.326 A:middle
view of the photo library
that we're working with here.

456
00:23:20.576 --> 00:23:23.676 A:middle
And so I'm running the
iOS 8 built-in photos app.

457
00:23:24.906 --> 00:23:28.496 A:middle
And you can see I've got
a series of Smart Albums

458
00:23:28.496 --> 00:23:33.046 A:middle
in this album list here and in
particular I've got 9 photos

459
00:23:33.046 --> 00:23:34.106 A:middle
in my Favorites Library.

460
00:23:34.636 --> 00:23:38.486 A:middle
Now I'm going to switch over
to the sample application

461
00:23:40.916 --> 00:23:45.636 A:middle
and we've got a listing here
with a special entry on top,

462
00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:47.526 A:middle
all the photos in
the Photo Library.

463
00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:48.556 A:middle
We can take a quick look.

464
00:23:48.556 --> 00:23:51.136 A:middle
You can see we've got a
pretty good size library here.

465
00:23:51.826 --> 00:23:53.666 A:middle
But we have also got
those Smart Albums.

466
00:23:54.186 --> 00:23:58.506 A:middle
So I'm going to tap
on the Favorites Album

467
00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:01.646 A:middle
and you can see it's
the same contents.

468
00:24:02.746 --> 00:24:05.016 A:middle
But it's pretty obvious
that one of the photos

469
00:24:05.016 --> 00:24:06.286 A:middle
in this group doesn't belong.

470
00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:11.236 A:middle
So I'm going to tap on my moose
and you can see when you look

471
00:24:11.236 --> 00:24:13.486 A:middle
at the sample code,
we're going to use --

472
00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:15.516 A:middle
I'll bring up the menu
with this Edit button,

473
00:24:16.396 --> 00:24:19.766 A:middle
but when I press
Unfavorite, the code is going

474
00:24:19.766 --> 00:24:22.556 A:middle
to create a change
request to set that asset

475
00:24:22.966 --> 00:24:24.506 A:middle
as not being a Favorite anymore.

476
00:24:25.986 --> 00:24:30.966 A:middle
Okay? When I back out to the
Favorites Smart Album you'll

477
00:24:30.966 --> 00:24:32.206 A:middle
notice the moose is gone.

478
00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:35.816 A:middle
Nothing in the code actually
asked to remove that moose

479
00:24:35.816 --> 00:24:36.816 A:middle
from that Smart Album.

480
00:24:37.056 --> 00:24:38.876 A:middle
This is one of those side
effects I was talking

481
00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:39.956 A:middle
about where a change

482
00:24:39.956 --> 00:24:42.676 A:middle
that I requested has
triggered a secondary change

483
00:24:42.946 --> 00:24:45.436 A:middle
that is reflected in
the user interface.

484
00:24:45.946 --> 00:24:51.686 A:middle
Now if we switch back to the
built-in photos application,

485
00:24:52.056 --> 00:24:55.096 A:middle
you can see that change is
immediately reflected there

486
00:24:55.096 --> 00:24:55.546 A:middle
as well.

487
00:24:55.976 --> 00:24:58.996 A:middle
The photo's been taken out of
that Favorites Smart Album, too.

488
00:25:00.046 --> 00:25:02.156 A:middle
Now there's one other
thing I want to quickly go

489
00:25:02.156 --> 00:25:06.556 A:middle
through to show you in
terms of the sample code,

490
00:25:06.896 --> 00:25:11.496 A:middle
and that is if I go into the
photo list and I find a photo

491
00:25:11.496 --> 00:25:15.256 A:middle
that I think the user wants to
delete, where I as the user want

492
00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:18.666 A:middle
to delete, I'm going to
go ahead and create a --

493
00:25:18.666 --> 00:25:19.886 A:middle
if you look at the
sample code --

494
00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:22.086 A:middle
you'll see I create a
Delete change request.

495
00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:25.946 A:middle
But there's no code
in the application

496
00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:27.006 A:middle
to provide this prompt.

497
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:30.716 A:middle
This is the photo library
performing some work

498
00:25:30.716 --> 00:25:32.626 A:middle
out of process to
let the user know

499
00:25:32.626 --> 00:25:35.916 A:middle
that an application has
requested a change that's

500
00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:38.916 A:middle
destructive to their library
and asking for confirmation.

501
00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:42.516 A:middle
So you can see, Allow Sample
Photos App to delete 1 photo?

502
00:25:42.516 --> 00:25:45.146 A:middle
And in this case I'm
not going to delete it.

503
00:25:45.456 --> 00:25:48.696 A:middle
But you can see how some of
the work that is performed

504
00:25:48.696 --> 00:25:51.076 A:middle
out of process can have such
an impact on your changes.

505
00:25:53.686 --> 00:25:54.126 A:middle
All right.

506
00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:58.936 A:middle
Well, that covers the work with
Model Objects that I wanted

507
00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:01.036 A:middle
to introduce from
the Photos Framework.

508
00:26:01.996 --> 00:26:03.296 A:middle
But there's a lot more
that you could see

509
00:26:03.296 --> 00:26:06.216 A:middle
in the sample application when
you look at all the images

510
00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:07.826 A:middle
and image data that
was presented.

511
00:26:08.256 --> 00:26:11.046 A:middle
So I'd like to invite Karl
up to talk about image

512
00:26:11.046 --> 00:26:11.926 A:middle
and video data, thanks.

513
00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:17.596 A:middle
[ Applause ]

514
00:26:18.096 --> 00:26:19.136 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, good morning.

515
00:26:19.136 --> 00:26:20.056 A:middle
My name is Karl Hsu.

516
00:26:20.056 --> 00:26:21.906 A:middle
I also work on the
iOS Photos Frameworks.

517
00:26:23.006 --> 00:26:25.816 A:middle
So we've just spent a
little while talking

518
00:26:25.816 --> 00:26:28.816 A:middle
about how you can discover
and work with the structure

519
00:26:28.896 --> 00:26:30.196 A:middle
of the user's photo library.

520
00:26:30.196 --> 00:26:30.926 A:middle
And that's great.

521
00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:33.266 A:middle
But we're missing
a key ingredient

522
00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:35.406 A:middle
because it is the
user's photo library.

523
00:26:35.946 --> 00:26:37.446 A:middle
How do we actually get a hold of

524
00:26:37.446 --> 00:26:39.906 A:middle
and display image
and video data?

525
00:26:41.456 --> 00:26:44.406 A:middle
Before we begin,
it's useful to know

526
00:26:44.746 --> 00:26:49.736 A:middle
that the user's photo library
actually caches a variety

527
00:26:49.736 --> 00:26:51.636 A:middle
of representations
for each asset.

528
00:26:51.866 --> 00:26:54.916 A:middle
For images, we might
have representations

529
00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:58.476 A:middle
that vary all the way from the
full size original all the way

530
00:26:58.476 --> 00:26:59.816 A:middle
down to small thumbnails.

531
00:27:00.526 --> 00:27:04.456 A:middle
Videos might be cached in a
variety of bitrates and sizes.

532
00:27:04.716 --> 00:27:06.836 A:middle
They might even be
streaming, okay?

533
00:27:07.486 --> 00:27:11.256 A:middle
With iCloud Photo Library we
might not actually have all

534
00:27:11.286 --> 00:27:13.896 A:middle
of those representations
cached on disks.

535
00:27:13.896 --> 00:27:15.906 A:middle
Some or all of them,
or in some cases,

536
00:27:15.906 --> 00:27:17.376 A:middle
even none of them
might be available.

537
00:27:18.246 --> 00:27:20.206 A:middle
That makes it kind of
a pain when you want

538
00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:21.206 A:middle
to display image data.

539
00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:24.346 A:middle
So what we have is
we provide you

540
00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:26.806 A:middle
with a class, the
PHImageManager.

541
00:27:27.306 --> 00:27:31.956 A:middle
The PHImageManager's job is to
abstract a way, sort of this,

542
00:27:31.956 --> 00:27:34.016 A:middle
your decision, from
having to decide, you know,

543
00:27:34.016 --> 00:27:36.886 A:middle
do I want a thumbnail, do I
want a medium size, a large?

544
00:27:36.986 --> 00:27:37.576 A:middle
What do you want?

545
00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:40.246 A:middle
So basically it's
a usage-based API.

546
00:27:40.756 --> 00:27:43.606 A:middle
For images, you tell us how
big do you want the image?

547
00:27:43.606 --> 00:27:44.886 A:middle
What are you trying
to do with it?

548
00:27:44.886 --> 00:27:47.016 A:middle
Are you trying to display it
in a small grid on the screen?

549
00:27:47.016 --> 00:27:48.916 A:middle
Are you trying to --
you want the full size?

550
00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:50.236 A:middle
You want something
that's screen size?

551
00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:51.866 A:middle
And we'll try to find the right,

552
00:27:51.866 --> 00:27:54.146 A:middle
the best available
representation we have for you.

553
00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:55.776 A:middle
Similarly, videos.

554
00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:57.426 A:middle
You tell us what
quality you'd like

555
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.736 A:middle
and what you plan
on doing with it.

556
00:27:58.736 --> 00:28:00.106 A:middle
Is it just for user playback?

557
00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:01.466 A:middle
Are you planning
on exporting it?

558
00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:03.076 A:middle
Or are you going to work
with it in some other way?

559
00:28:03.666 --> 00:28:05.946 A:middle
And we'll try to pick
the right representation.

560
00:28:07.506 --> 00:28:08.866 A:middle
One key thing here is

561
00:28:08.866 --> 00:28:12.416 A:middle
that unlike the Model
[inaudible] API,

562
00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:14.486 A:middle
which is largely synchronous,

563
00:28:15.336 --> 00:28:19.486 A:middle
the image request APIs
are largely asynchronous.

564
00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:23.356 A:middle
And that's because even if
the data is available locally,

565
00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:26.596 A:middle
we may have to do work before
we can hand you the data.

566
00:28:26.596 --> 00:28:28.146 A:middle
JPEGs have to be
read off a disk.

567
00:28:28.146 --> 00:28:29.136 A:middle
They have to be decoded.

568
00:28:29.726 --> 00:28:33.716 A:middle
But the most important case
is in the case of something

569
00:28:33.716 --> 00:28:34.996 A:middle
like iCloud Photo Library,

570
00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:38.636 A:middle
we may not have the data
locally available at all, right?

571
00:28:38.636 --> 00:28:41.136 A:middle
We may have to go out
to the network, get it,

572
00:28:41.416 --> 00:28:44.036 A:middle
and then bring it back to you.

573
00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:46.676 A:middle
So let's take a quick look
at what that looks like.

574
00:28:46.926 --> 00:28:49.856 A:middle
This is a very straightforward
fetch request.

575
00:28:49.996 --> 00:28:51.516 A:middle
I'm sorry, image request.

576
00:28:52.636 --> 00:28:55.336 A:middle
In this case we're
trying to fill sort

577
00:28:55.336 --> 00:28:58.166 A:middle
of a straightforward
four-across grid on an iPhone.

578
00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:01.106 A:middle
It turns out to be
about 160 by 160 pixels.

579
00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:03.556 A:middle
So we set the target size,

580
00:29:03.556 --> 00:29:06.336 A:middle
we tell it that the image
should fill that target size,

581
00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:07.876 A:middle
and then we issue the request.

582
00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:08.716 A:middle
And when it comes back,

583
00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:11.706 A:middle
if there's any image data
available, we'll hand it to you.

584
00:29:11.706 --> 00:29:14.916 A:middle
The Info Dictionary is there and
we'll tell you a little bit more

585
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:16.146 A:middle
about what we handed you back.

586
00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.826 A:middle
Specifically, is
it a substandard,

587
00:29:17.826 --> 00:29:19.096 A:middle
it is the right size?

588
00:29:19.656 --> 00:29:19.966 A:middle
It's good.

589
00:29:21.316 --> 00:29:23.016 A:middle
So let's take a look
at a little bit more

590
00:29:23.016 --> 00:29:24.356 A:middle
of an advanced image request.

591
00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:29.086 A:middle
So when you want to make
a more advanced request,

592
00:29:29.086 --> 00:29:30.986 A:middle
you create an
ImageRequestOption.

593
00:29:31.876 --> 00:29:34.516 A:middle
In this case, after
I create the option,

594
00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:37.356 A:middle
I really want this photo, right?

595
00:29:38.046 --> 00:29:40.136 A:middle
So I'm going to tell the
option that, yes, it's allowed

596
00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:41.236 A:middle
to go out to the network.

597
00:29:41.236 --> 00:29:43.906 A:middle
It can go out to iCloud
and fetch the data down.

598
00:29:44.156 --> 00:29:45.786 A:middle
And because that might
take a little bit of time,

599
00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:47.306 A:middle
I'd like a progress
handler as well.

600
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:48.936 A:middle
Again, this is a good idea.

601
00:29:48.936 --> 00:29:50.526 A:middle
You can always show
the user that we're,

602
00:29:50.526 --> 00:29:52.336 A:middle
in fact, doing work, okay?

603
00:29:52.336 --> 00:29:56.036 A:middle
And then, finally, just
set it as an option

604
00:29:56.036 --> 00:29:57.486 A:middle
when you actually
make the request.

605
00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:05.146 A:middle
I want to spend a second
and talk about the callback

606
00:30:05.676 --> 00:30:07.316 A:middle
that actually produces the data.

607
00:30:07.696 --> 00:30:09.176 A:middle
There's two things
to keep in mind.

608
00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:14.016 A:middle
Again, this block will be
called back on the main thread.

609
00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.296 A:middle
And the reason is
because the feeling is

610
00:30:17.296 --> 00:30:18.916 A:middle
that generally you
want to use it for --

611
00:30:18.916 --> 00:30:19.996 A:middle
if it's an asynchronous
callback,

612
00:30:19.996 --> 00:30:22.046 A:middle
you're typically using it for
display on the main thread.

613
00:30:22.726 --> 00:30:24.856 A:middle
There's an optional way to
make a synchronous request

614
00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.286 A:middle
if you're working in
background threads.

615
00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:28.656 A:middle
Okay. The other thing
is actually,

616
00:30:29.306 --> 00:30:32.516 A:middle
this block can be called
multiple times for each request

617
00:30:32.926 --> 00:30:37.906 A:middle
because it turns out that a
really common UIDesign is the

618
00:30:37.906 --> 00:30:40.926 A:middle
user wants to see their image
data as soon as possible.

619
00:30:41.546 --> 00:30:44.726 A:middle
So if we have any image
data available we'll return

620
00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:46.586 A:middle
that to you right away.

621
00:30:47.836 --> 00:30:50.346 A:middle
And then, if that
isn't sufficient

622
00:30:50.466 --> 00:30:53.116 A:middle
to fulfill your request,
we go out,

623
00:30:53.526 --> 00:30:56.606 A:middle
possibly to the disk,
possibly to iCloud.

624
00:30:56.836 --> 00:30:58.796 A:middle
We'll go get the data
and, when it arrives,

625
00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.966 A:middle
then we'll call it
a second time.

626
00:31:01.356 --> 00:31:03.356 A:middle
[ Applause ]

627
00:31:03.696 --> 00:31:04.076 A:middle
Thank you.

628
00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:06.806 A:middle
Of course, if the
data's already available,

629
00:31:07.086 --> 00:31:08.886 A:middle
then you only get
the first callout.

630
00:31:09.396 --> 00:31:12.606 A:middle
Let's take a quick look
at requesting videos.

631
00:31:12.606 --> 00:31:15.616 A:middle
So in this case, the user
has scrolled to some video

632
00:31:15.616 --> 00:31:17.056 A:middle
and they just want playback.

633
00:31:17.216 --> 00:31:19.946 A:middle
So we're requesting a
PlayerItem for the video.

634
00:31:20.006 --> 00:31:22.366 A:middle
When we get back a player item
you can create an AVPlayer

635
00:31:22.366 --> 00:31:23.376 A:middle
out of it.

636
00:31:23.376 --> 00:31:24.776 A:middle
It looks very much
like the Image Request.

637
00:31:24.776 --> 00:31:25.706 A:middle
It's pretty straightforward.

638
00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:30.426 A:middle
And, again, if we want a
more advanced request --

639
00:31:30.536 --> 00:31:35.416 A:middle
let's say, the user now
wants to push this video

640
00:31:35.446 --> 00:31:37.846 A:middle
up to their own sharing service,
a different sharing service.

641
00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:40.586 A:middle
So now we're going to
create a VideoRequestOption.

642
00:31:41.046 --> 00:31:44.736 A:middle
And, of course, because
we're sharing it,

643
00:31:44.846 --> 00:31:47.806 A:middle
we want it to be high quality.

644
00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:51.896 A:middle
Maybe you're on an iPhone and
you wanted the full 1080P, okay?

645
00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:53.916 A:middle
So, we want it to
be high quality

646
00:31:53.976 --> 00:31:55.386 A:middle
and if it's not available --

647
00:31:56.036 --> 00:31:57.266 A:middle
because we were playing
it before.

648
00:31:57.266 --> 00:31:58.346 A:middle
That might have been streaming.

649
00:31:58.876 --> 00:32:00.626 A:middle
We are, you know, we say,
okay, it's all right.

650
00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:02.286 A:middle
You can go out to the
network and download it.

651
00:32:02.576 --> 00:32:04.866 A:middle
And it's particularly
important for videos, of course,

652
00:32:04.866 --> 00:32:08.106 A:middle
to have progress because
videos can be very large.

653
00:32:08.696 --> 00:32:11.026 A:middle
And then, finally,
we set the option.

654
00:32:11.326 --> 00:32:13.636 A:middle
Note here that we're actually
using a slightly different API.

655
00:32:13.636 --> 00:32:18.486 A:middle
We're specifically requesting
an export session rather

656
00:32:18.486 --> 00:32:19.966 A:middle
than a playback item.

657
00:32:20.496 --> 00:32:22.356 A:middle
So this is good.

658
00:32:23.596 --> 00:32:26.286 A:middle
We can fetch individual images,
and that works pretty well.

659
00:32:26.446 --> 00:32:30.656 A:middle
But, it's really common
for a photo app to want

660
00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:32.066 A:middle
to show lots of images.

661
00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:33.566 A:middle
The user doesn't want to scroll

662
00:32:33.566 --> 00:32:34.966 A:middle
through their images
one at a time.

663
00:32:35.326 --> 00:32:37.226 A:middle
They want to see
a grid of images

664
00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:41.946 A:middle
in either a regular square grid
or a more interesting, you know,

665
00:32:41.946 --> 00:32:43.516 A:middle
tile and brick mortar layout.

666
00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:45.626 A:middle
That poses some performance
problems.

667
00:32:45.626 --> 00:32:47.936 A:middle
Even if the individual
images are relatively cheap,

668
00:32:47.936 --> 00:32:48.676 A:middle
there's a lot of them.

669
00:32:49.216 --> 00:32:50.276 A:middle
So what do we do?

670
00:32:50.276 --> 00:32:52.836 A:middle
The general thing that people
want to do is you create a cache

671
00:32:52.836 --> 00:32:54.446 A:middle
around what the user's
looking at.

672
00:32:54.446 --> 00:32:56.256 A:middle
You figure out which
direction they're going

673
00:32:56.256 --> 00:32:58.346 A:middle
and you start caching
ahead of them

674
00:32:58.346 --> 00:32:59.666 A:middle
and you stop caching behind.

675
00:33:00.126 --> 00:33:01.506 A:middle
So this is a pain, right?

676
00:33:01.826 --> 00:33:03.856 A:middle
You kind of have to
track all of this data.

677
00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:06.276 A:middle
You have to know to retrieve
stuff from that cache.

678
00:33:06.496 --> 00:33:08.676 A:middle
We've already got an API
for doing a lot of this.

679
00:33:09.616 --> 00:33:13.246 A:middle
And that API is the
PHCachingImageManager, okay?

680
00:33:13.766 --> 00:33:17.216 A:middle
The caching image manager's job
is exactly what it sounds like.

681
00:33:17.216 --> 00:33:20.496 A:middle
Its job is to cache images
on your behalf, okay?

682
00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:23.616 A:middle
As you make requests against
the caching image manager,

683
00:33:23.686 --> 00:33:26.526 A:middle
if it's in its cache, it
will return that directly.

684
00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:28.736 A:middle
And if not, it will
automatically fall back

685
00:33:28.736 --> 00:33:30.416 A:middle
to the default image
request behavior.

686
00:33:31.066 --> 00:33:33.116 A:middle
Now the general suggestion is

687
00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:36.006 A:middle
that you create a caching
image manager for each sort

688
00:33:36.006 --> 00:33:38.776 A:middle
of distinct view controller
that you have in your app.

689
00:33:39.006 --> 00:33:41.816 A:middle
That's because each view
controller typically has its own

690
00:33:41.816 --> 00:33:45.126 A:middle
display of image data, right?

691
00:33:45.126 --> 00:33:47.856 A:middle
You know, a grid view
controller is going to behave --

692
00:33:47.856 --> 00:33:49.596 A:middle
it's going to need
different caching behaviors

693
00:33:49.596 --> 00:33:52.296 A:middle
than like a one-up view where
you're scrolling through.

694
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.496 A:middle
So let's take a quick look at
what I'm talking about here.

695
00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:57.486 A:middle
So we have the user's phone.

696
00:33:58.226 --> 00:34:00.106 A:middle
They're looking at
some nice pictures

697
00:34:00.106 --> 00:34:01.386 A:middle
and they're scrolling
through it.

698
00:34:01.676 --> 00:34:03.056 A:middle
Now this is what the user sees.

699
00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:07.376 A:middle
But we know that underneath what
they actually have is this sort

700
00:34:07.376 --> 00:34:10.856 A:middle
of long scroll view of
photos above and behind.

701
00:34:10.956 --> 00:34:13.096 A:middle
And what they only see
is the visible range.

702
00:34:13.706 --> 00:34:17.366 A:middle
So as they're scrolling down,
we want to start caching ahead

703
00:34:17.366 --> 00:34:20.636 A:middle
of where they are so that the
data's available immediately

704
00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:23.496 A:middle
when you need to
display it to the user.

705
00:34:23.946 --> 00:34:25.616 A:middle
And, of course, for
memory reasons,

706
00:34:25.616 --> 00:34:27.156 A:middle
we want to stop caching behind.

707
00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:29.686 A:middle
You just sort of calculate
this range and maintain it,

708
00:34:30.266 --> 00:34:32.726 A:middle
and as you scroll
just keep updating.

709
00:34:33.896 --> 00:34:38.106 A:middle
Okay? The API for the caching
image manager is actually

710
00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:38.936 A:middle
pretty straightforward.

711
00:34:39.376 --> 00:34:42.176 A:middle
You calculate what going
to be visible soon.

712
00:34:42.406 --> 00:34:43.735 A:middle
You tell us to start caching it.

713
00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:50.176 A:middle
And as stuff is scrolled off,
you tell us to stop caching it.

714
00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:54.726 A:middle
The only key thing here is when
you start and stop caching,

715
00:34:56.036 --> 00:34:58.936 A:middle
use the same target
size, content mode,

716
00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:02.066 A:middle
and options that you will use
for the actual request image.

717
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:05.086 A:middle
Otherwise, we don't
know how to look it up.

718
00:35:05.346 --> 00:35:08.976 A:middle
So now we know how to get hold
of image data and we know how

719
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:10.246 A:middle
to get a hold of it fast.

720
00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:12.746 A:middle
We know how to get a
hold of video data.

721
00:35:12.746 --> 00:35:16.096 A:middle
But, of course, just looking
at data's only half the story.

722
00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:19.466 A:middle
Users love to touch
their photos.

723
00:35:19.466 --> 00:35:22.706 A:middle
They want to adjust them, crop
it so it looks just right,

724
00:35:22.706 --> 00:35:24.436 A:middle
apply a filter so
their kids look,

725
00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:26.196 A:middle
you know, extra special pretty.

726
00:35:26.706 --> 00:35:28.776 A:middle
So let's talk about editing.

727
00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:34.316 A:middle
If the asset is editable,
the edits are now in-place.

728
00:35:34.906 --> 00:35:38.086 A:middle
Okay? You no longer need to
save your edits as a new asset.

729
00:35:38.086 --> 00:35:41.166 A:middle
You can edit any
asset that's editable.

730
00:35:41.766 --> 00:35:45.516 A:middle
The edits are, just
like in the real photos

731
00:35:45.516 --> 00:35:46.566 A:middle
out there, are nondestructive.

732
00:35:46.566 --> 00:35:48.036 A:middle
The user can always revert.

733
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:49.816 A:middle
You can also programmatically
revert.

734
00:35:50.966 --> 00:35:53.026 A:middle
Changes that you make
are visible everywhere.

735
00:35:53.306 --> 00:35:54.516 A:middle
They'll show up in your app.

736
00:35:54.636 --> 00:35:55.906 A:middle
They show up in the photos app.

737
00:35:55.906 --> 00:36:00.116 A:middle
They show up in mail
messages, other 3rd-party apps.

738
00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:04.256 A:middle
And with iCloud Photo Library
they're actually visible

739
00:36:04.256 --> 00:36:05.956 A:middle
across all of your
devices as well.

740
00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:09.556 A:middle
Okay. So how does editing work?

741
00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:14.586 A:middle
Well, at a very simple,
basic level,

742
00:36:14.666 --> 00:36:16.606 A:middle
you ask us for an input image.

743
00:36:18.066 --> 00:36:21.036 A:middle
We hand it to you.

744
00:36:21.146 --> 00:36:24.196 A:middle
And you do whatever
transformations you want

745
00:36:24.196 --> 00:36:24.706 A:middle
to do on it.

746
00:36:24.706 --> 00:36:25.496 A:middle
You can crop it.

747
00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:26.356 A:middle
You can edit it.

748
00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:30.456 A:middle
You can go and do, you know,
pixel operations on it.

749
00:36:30.456 --> 00:36:33.956 A:middle
And when you're done,
you generate a new image,

750
00:36:33.956 --> 00:36:36.746 A:middle
a new output image,
and you hand it to us,

751
00:36:36.746 --> 00:36:38.316 A:middle
and then we save it
on top of the asset.

752
00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:39.756 A:middle
That's it.

753
00:36:40.676 --> 00:36:43.976 A:middle
So let's take a look at
how that works, okay?

754
00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:47.016 A:middle
First you want to ask
us for the input image.

755
00:36:47.586 --> 00:36:52.386 A:middle
You ask the asset for its
content editing input, okay?

756
00:36:53.056 --> 00:36:54.876 A:middle
And what that comes with is,

757
00:36:54.876 --> 00:36:57.516 A:middle
the content editing input
carries a bunch of information

758
00:36:57.516 --> 00:37:00.746 A:middle
that you'll need in order
to actually do your work.

759
00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:03.076 A:middle
It gives you a URL
with a reference

760
00:37:03.076 --> 00:37:04.236 A:middle
to the full size asset.

761
00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:06.376 A:middle
It gives you some
orientation information.

762
00:37:06.946 --> 00:37:10.026 A:middle
So, in this case, I'm
creating a core-image image

763
00:37:10.476 --> 00:37:11.936 A:middle
and I'm sure I'm
going to be using some

764
00:37:11.936 --> 00:37:14.656 A:middle
of the new filter stuff that
we have available for you now.

765
00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.566 A:middle
And I'm going to do some work.

766
00:37:17.876 --> 00:37:19.896 A:middle
So, I've done some work.

767
00:37:19.896 --> 00:37:20.696 A:middle
You just cropped it.

768
00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:22.006 A:middle
Maybe you applied a filter.

769
00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:22.546 A:middle
It looks great.

770
00:37:23.656 --> 00:37:24.326 A:middle
How do we save it?

771
00:37:26.006 --> 00:37:29.126 A:middle
Well, you create, ta-da,
a Content Editing Output.

772
00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:33.876 A:middle
You take your data, the
fully-rendered output,

773
00:37:33.876 --> 00:37:36.056 A:middle
save it as a JPEG,
write it to the URL,

774
00:37:36.056 --> 00:37:38.296 A:middle
and then you set
the adjustmentData.

775
00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:40.876 A:middle
I'll talk about the
adjustmentData in just a second.

776
00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.676 A:middle
And then how do you save it?

777
00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:45.196 A:middle
It's the same as saving
any other model change.

778
00:37:45.556 --> 00:37:49.016 A:middle
You create a asset
change request.

779
00:37:49.556 --> 00:37:51.506 A:middle
You sent the content
editing output on it,

780
00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:54.706 A:middle
put the whole thing in a
change block, and that's it.

781
00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.806 A:middle
So, it's a little
bit misleading,

782
00:37:57.806 --> 00:37:59.516 A:middle
actually when I said
it was that simple.

783
00:37:59.726 --> 00:38:02.476 A:middle
So there's another
wrinkle which is,

784
00:38:03.036 --> 00:38:07.926 A:middle
what if someone has
already edited that image?

785
00:38:08.926 --> 00:38:12.176 A:middle
Well, the key point
here is that actually

786
00:38:12.766 --> 00:38:17.426 A:middle
when you edit an image you
actually have the base image

787
00:38:18.136 --> 00:38:19.296 A:middle
and some adjustment data.

788
00:38:19.626 --> 00:38:21.916 A:middle
Your output image, the thing
that you give us at the end,

789
00:38:21.916 --> 00:38:22.866 A:middle
is actually the result

790
00:38:22.866 --> 00:38:25.656 A:middle
of applying this
adjustment to the base image.

791
00:38:26.266 --> 00:38:31.846 A:middle
So, really, what we hand you
is the base image plus whatever

792
00:38:31.846 --> 00:38:33.926 A:middle
adjustment data is
already on that image.

793
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:37.266 A:middle
And that way the user
can continue editing

794
00:38:37.406 --> 00:38:41.286 A:middle
as if they had never left
their editing session, right?

795
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:45.726 A:middle
You do a crop-down and then what
we hand you is the original plus

796
00:38:45.726 --> 00:38:48.286 A:middle
the crop information so that
you can show the user the crop,

797
00:38:48.286 --> 00:38:50.366 A:middle
that they can extend
the crop in and out.

798
00:38:50.366 --> 00:38:51.546 A:middle
They can remove it entirely.

799
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:52.266 A:middle
They can change it.

800
00:38:52.926 --> 00:38:58.436 A:middle
And when you're done, you
hand us your output image

801
00:38:59.536 --> 00:39:01.216 A:middle
and the new adjustment data.

802
00:39:01.536 --> 00:39:03.006 A:middle
So that cycle will
just continue.

803
00:39:03.006 --> 00:39:06.286 A:middle
So the next person that asks
will get back the base image

804
00:39:06.286 --> 00:39:08.426 A:middle
plus the new adjustment data.

805
00:39:09.736 --> 00:39:11.886 A:middle
So how do you save
the adjustment data?

806
00:39:11.886 --> 00:39:13.876 A:middle
Well, the adjustment
data actually can be --

807
00:39:13.876 --> 00:39:16.336 A:middle
you use a PHAdjustmentData
object,

808
00:39:16.336 --> 00:39:20.116 A:middle
but really the data can be
whatever you want, all right?

809
00:39:20.486 --> 00:39:22.926 A:middle
For instance, it could be
the name and parameters

810
00:39:22.926 --> 00:39:24.236 A:middle
for a core image filter.

811
00:39:24.456 --> 00:39:28.586 A:middle
It could be anything that you
want that describes your edits.

812
00:39:30.226 --> 00:39:33.596 A:middle
Notice here that actually beyond
just that data we also ask you

813
00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:36.296 A:middle
to include a format
identifier and a format version.

814
00:39:37.616 --> 00:39:40.146 A:middle
They basically are a way for you

815
00:39:40.146 --> 00:39:43.766 A:middle
to identify what
edit it actually is.

816
00:39:43.766 --> 00:39:44.906 A:middle
Who did this edit?

817
00:39:44.906 --> 00:39:46.156 A:middle
What's the format of it?

818
00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:50.266 A:middle
Okay? And I'll talk a little
bit more about that in a second.

819
00:39:50.756 --> 00:39:54.286 A:middle
So, I misled you again.

820
00:39:54.746 --> 00:39:56.636 A:middle
There is one additional
case, of course.

821
00:39:57.156 --> 00:39:59.976 A:middle
What if someone else
had edited the image?

822
00:40:00.076 --> 00:40:04.786 A:middle
The scenario that I
described before is great

823
00:40:04.786 --> 00:40:07.046 A:middle
if you were the one who
previously edited it.

824
00:40:07.046 --> 00:40:11.106 A:middle
But if somebody went to App
A and they applied a crop?

825
00:40:11.106 --> 00:40:15.926 A:middle
And then they go to App B and
they want to do more editing.

826
00:40:16.236 --> 00:40:19.216 A:middle
Well, you have to tell us
whether you understand the

827
00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:19.866 A:middle
adjustment data.

828
00:40:19.866 --> 00:40:20.516 A:middle
We'll ask you.

829
00:40:20.516 --> 00:40:21.896 A:middle
We'll give you the
PHAdjustmentData.

830
00:40:22.776 --> 00:40:23.496 A:middle
And you tell us.

831
00:40:23.986 --> 00:40:25.376 A:middle
Do you understand what this is?

832
00:40:25.836 --> 00:40:26.596 A:middle
So, looking at this,

833
00:40:26.596 --> 00:40:28.666 A:middle
this actually seems
relatively straightforward

834
00:40:28.986 --> 00:40:30.566 A:middle
but we're not putting
any restrictions

835
00:40:30.566 --> 00:40:33.136 A:middle
on what the format identifier
and the format version can be.

836
00:40:33.666 --> 00:40:35.956 A:middle
Several developers from
different companies could,

837
00:40:35.956 --> 00:40:39.106 A:middle
for instance, get together
and define a common identifier

838
00:40:39.106 --> 00:40:42.066 A:middle
and version and, you know,
adjustment data format.

839
00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:45.226 A:middle
And that way the user could move
seamlessly between those apps.

840
00:40:45.226 --> 00:40:48.146 A:middle
Okay. But let's see
what happens,

841
00:40:48.236 --> 00:40:51.416 A:middle
depending on what you return
when we ask you this question,

842
00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:53.176 A:middle
can you understand this?

843
00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:55.026 A:middle
Do you understand it?

844
00:40:55.406 --> 00:40:56.566 A:middle
Yes. You say, yes.

845
00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:57.276 A:middle
That's great.

846
00:40:57.516 --> 00:41:00.706 A:middle
We'll hand you the base
image and the adjustment data

847
00:41:00.706 --> 00:41:03.786 A:middle
and you can behave as if
the user had just sort

848
00:41:03.786 --> 00:41:05.616 A:middle
of turned around, waited
a second, and come back

849
00:41:05.616 --> 00:41:06.706 A:middle
and started editing again.

850
00:41:07.266 --> 00:41:08.656 A:middle
That's sort of the ideal case.

851
00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:12.336 A:middle
But what if you tell
no, you don't?

852
00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:13.886 A:middle
Well, in this case,
unfortunately,

853
00:41:13.886 --> 00:41:14.816 A:middle
we don't have any choice.

854
00:41:14.816 --> 00:41:16.826 A:middle
We have to hand you the
fully rendered output

855
00:41:16.826 --> 00:41:17.706 A:middle
from the previous edit.

856
00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:21.576 A:middle
So the user can continue
editing but they can't back out.

857
00:41:21.576 --> 00:41:25.336 A:middle
Like, in this case, the previous
app applied a noir filter

858
00:41:25.576 --> 00:41:27.346 A:middle
and it's effectively
blocking my filter.

859
00:41:27.346 --> 00:41:29.036 A:middle
We've thrown away the
color information.

860
00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:29.536 A:middle
We don't have it.

861
00:41:30.206 --> 00:41:33.206 A:middle
If the user wants to go
back, they basically have

862
00:41:33.236 --> 00:41:34.486 A:middle
to revert back to original.

863
00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:38.186 A:middle
Okay. So, let's take
a quick demo.

864
00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:39.836 A:middle
So, here we are.

865
00:41:40.446 --> 00:41:41.866 A:middle
So, this is what we had before.

866
00:41:42.586 --> 00:41:44.436 A:middle
And I want to take a look.

867
00:41:45.956 --> 00:41:46.536 A:middle
Let's see.

868
00:41:46.536 --> 00:41:47.916 A:middle
Let's look at our
Favorites again.

869
00:41:49.636 --> 00:41:51.476 A:middle
And here we go.

870
00:41:51.986 --> 00:41:52.856 A:middle
She looks very nice.

871
00:41:53.926 --> 00:41:55.606 A:middle
But I want to play
with it a little bit.

872
00:41:55.606 --> 00:41:57.296 A:middle
I think that this
photo could be better.

873
00:41:58.706 --> 00:42:02.006 A:middle
So, actually, I'm going
to -- let's try Posterize.

874
00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:03.876 A:middle
You know what?

875
00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:06.106 A:middle
I didn't -- I don't know.

876
00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:07.816 A:middle
That doesn't look
quite right to me.

877
00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:11.496 A:middle
Okay? So at this point we
started with the original image

878
00:42:11.496 --> 00:42:12.566 A:middle
and there are no adjustments.

879
00:42:12.566 --> 00:42:14.206 A:middle
So we didn't even
ask do you understand

880
00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:14.906 A:middle
because it doesn't matter.

881
00:42:15.336 --> 00:42:16.326 A:middle
We had to do the base image.

882
00:42:16.656 --> 00:42:18.796 A:middle
This time, when I go
into edit, what's going

883
00:42:18.796 --> 00:42:22.496 A:middle
to happen is we're going to
say, do you understand the edit?

884
00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.536 A:middle
And this app happens
to be the same app.

885
00:42:24.536 --> 00:42:25.816 A:middle
So I says yes, I understand.

886
00:42:26.156 --> 00:42:29.386 A:middle
So this time I hand
you the base image,

887
00:42:29.846 --> 00:42:32.826 A:middle
which is effectively the
original, plus the adjustment

888
00:42:32.826 --> 00:42:35.946 A:middle
that did the Posterize
which allows us

889
00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:38.206 A:middle
to switch it completely.

890
00:42:38.206 --> 00:42:40.386 A:middle
And now it's in sepia, right?

891
00:42:40.436 --> 00:42:43.116 A:middle
But it's not sepia applied
on top of the Posterize.

892
00:42:43.116 --> 00:42:45.466 A:middle
It's sepia applied
instead of the Posterize.

893
00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:46.876 A:middle
Actually, I kind of like this.

894
00:42:46.876 --> 00:42:47.796 A:middle
I think I'm going to leave it.

895
00:42:47.796 --> 00:42:50.096 A:middle
I like that old-time look.

896
00:42:50.796 --> 00:42:53.206 A:middle
And just to prove it, look.

897
00:42:54.386 --> 00:42:55.706 A:middle
The photos' app sees it as well.

898
00:42:57.286 --> 00:42:57.676 A:middle
All right.

899
00:42:58.036 --> 00:43:00.466 A:middle
So we've talked about
doing this in the context

900
00:43:00.466 --> 00:43:03.376 A:middle
of your own application,
but, of course, as we showed

901
00:43:03.376 --> 00:43:05.886 A:middle
in the keynote, we can
do this from inside

902
00:43:05.886 --> 00:43:06.926 A:middle
of the photo's app as well.

903
00:43:06.986 --> 00:43:09.816 A:middle
And to tell you about how
to do that, Simon Bovet.

904
00:43:11.516 --> 00:43:16.736 A:middle
[ Applause ]

905
00:43:17.236 --> 00:43:18.656 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

906
00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:20.376 A:middle
My name is Simon Bovet.

907
00:43:20.376 --> 00:43:22.616 A:middle
And in this last
part of the session,

908
00:43:22.966 --> 00:43:24.876 A:middle
let's talk about Photo
Editing Extensions.

909
00:43:26.326 --> 00:43:28.206 A:middle
So what are Photo
Editing Extensions?

910
00:43:28.676 --> 00:43:30.626 A:middle
How can they be useful
to you developers?

911
00:43:31.086 --> 00:43:32.716 A:middle
And what do they
bring to our users?

912
00:43:32.796 --> 00:43:39.856 A:middle
So it's a new feature in iOS 8
that allows the users to access

913
00:43:39.966 --> 00:43:44.846 A:middle
to your Image or Video
Editing tool right

914
00:43:44.846 --> 00:43:49.076 A:middle
from within the built-in
camera or photo applications.

915
00:43:50.486 --> 00:43:52.856 A:middle
No need for the user to
switch between applications.

916
00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:56.036 A:middle
No need for the user to
grant specific access rights

917
00:43:56.036 --> 00:43:56.876 A:middle
to your application.

918
00:43:57.206 --> 00:44:01.696 A:middle
It's a very simple way for your
tool to reach its audience.

919
00:44:02.226 --> 00:44:03.606 A:middle
And we think it's a great way

920
00:44:03.836 --> 00:44:07.096 A:middle
to put your creativity inside
the hands of our users.

921
00:44:08.086 --> 00:44:11.326 A:middle
So this feature has been shown
in the Keynote on Monday,

922
00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:13.356 A:middle
but let me refresh your
memories with a few slides.

923
00:44:14.256 --> 00:44:20.346 A:middle
So here we are on iPhone editing
an image using the iOS 8's

924
00:44:20.446 --> 00:44:22.036 A:middle
built-in Photos Application.

925
00:44:22.996 --> 00:44:25.966 A:middle
The user can tap on
the top left button

926
00:44:26.796 --> 00:44:29.576 A:middle
and access any available
editing extension.

927
00:44:30.596 --> 00:44:31.266 A:middle
Can pick one.

928
00:44:31.946 --> 00:44:37.326 A:middle
And this could be your Editing
tool extending the reading

929
00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:39.056 A:middle
capabilities of the
built-in apps.

930
00:44:39.876 --> 00:44:41.326 A:middle
So now the user can interact

931
00:44:41.326 --> 00:44:43.036 A:middle
with whatever interface
you want to provide.

932
00:44:43.676 --> 00:44:47.796 A:middle
And when the user is done,
the changes are saved right

933
00:44:47.796 --> 00:44:50.156 A:middle
in place inside the
user's photo library.

934
00:44:50.626 --> 00:44:52.686 A:middle
No need to create the
duplicated assets.

935
00:44:53.506 --> 00:44:56.276 A:middle
And if the user has turned
on iCloud Photo Library,

936
00:44:56.916 --> 00:44:59.986 A:middle
those changes will be
applied to all of the devices.

937
00:45:00.436 --> 00:45:01.766 A:middle
So the user could go on his iPad

938
00:45:01.766 --> 00:45:04.896 A:middle
and then draw your beautiful
effects on a larger screen.

939
00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:09.386 A:middle
So, what do you need to
create your own photo

940
00:45:09.386 --> 00:45:10.426 A:middle
editing extension?

941
00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:13.426 A:middle
And it turns out that
it's really simple.

942
00:45:13.926 --> 00:45:15.236 A:middle
It's basically three steps.

943
00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:18.606 A:middle
The first one is to create
an app extension target.

944
00:45:19.896 --> 00:45:22.016 A:middle
The second one is to
provide a view controller

945
00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:24.556 A:middle
which will manage the
UI of your extension.

946
00:45:25.406 --> 00:45:27.286 A:middle
And then this view
controller needs

947
00:45:27.286 --> 00:45:31.216 A:middle
to adopt a specific protocol
which is a set of methods

948
00:45:31.736 --> 00:45:33.546 A:middle
that photos will call in order

949
00:45:33.546 --> 00:45:34.926 A:middle
to communicate with
your extension.

950
00:45:35.456 --> 00:45:41.966 A:middle
The good news is the first two
steps are really easy thanks

951
00:45:41.966 --> 00:45:42.886 A:middle
to the new Xcode.

952
00:45:44.186 --> 00:45:46.196 A:middle
Basically all that
you need to do is,

953
00:45:46.196 --> 00:45:49.856 A:middle
from your application's Xcode
project, add a new target

954
00:45:50.846 --> 00:45:53.506 A:middle
and select the Photo
Editing Extension template.

955
00:45:54.496 --> 00:45:57.736 A:middle
Xcode will create whatever is
necessary for you go get started

956
00:45:58.156 --> 00:45:59.306 A:middle
and have something working.

957
00:46:00.406 --> 00:46:04.026 A:middle
It will create a view controller
which you can start using

958
00:46:04.836 --> 00:46:07.266 A:middle
or which you can replace
with your own if you happen

959
00:46:07.266 --> 00:46:10.026 A:middle
to have your existing
tool or view controller

960
00:46:10.026 --> 00:46:10.926 A:middle
that you want to reuse.

961
00:46:11.456 --> 00:46:13.196 A:middle
A note about the user interface.

962
00:46:14.506 --> 00:46:16.866 A:middle
You've seen photo extensions
are shown full screen.

963
00:46:17.746 --> 00:46:21.116 A:middle
Now on the top bar, with the
Cancel and Done buttons as well

964
00:46:21.116 --> 00:46:23.666 A:middle
as the title of your
application,

965
00:46:24.046 --> 00:46:26.396 A:middle
it's shown automatically
for you by the Photos app.

966
00:46:27.646 --> 00:46:30.636 A:middle
So if you say you like to
design your extension not

967
00:46:30.636 --> 00:46:32.076 A:middle
to have its own navigation bar.

968
00:46:34.886 --> 00:46:38.096 A:middle
Now on to the protocol
adoption, so the protocol

969
00:46:38.096 --> 00:46:39.946 A:middle
which is specific
to photo extensions.

970
00:46:41.186 --> 00:46:44.276 A:middle
And this protocol is defining
the photo's UIFramework

971
00:46:44.926 --> 00:46:47.426 A:middle
and is the
PHContentEditingController.

972
00:46:48.276 --> 00:46:49.696 A:middle
It consists of four methods.

973
00:46:50.336 --> 00:46:53.536 A:middle
And the first one,
quite obviously,

974
00:46:54.116 --> 00:46:57.066 A:middle
is called when the user
selects your extension.

975
00:46:57.796 --> 00:47:02.056 A:middle
And this where you get the input
data before your extension is

976
00:47:02.056 --> 00:47:02.986 A:middle
presented onscreen.

977
00:47:03.626 --> 00:47:09.446 A:middle
A simple implementation
could look like this.

978
00:47:09.656 --> 00:47:12.966 A:middle
And the first thing you might
notice is that the input object

979
00:47:12.966 --> 00:47:15.586 A:middle
which is given to you,
the PHContentEditingInput,

980
00:47:15.646 --> 00:47:17.686 A:middle
is exactly the same object

981
00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:20.496 A:middle
as the one Karl described
just a few minutes ago.

982
00:47:21.086 --> 00:47:23.286 A:middle
So, basically, we have
the exact same classes,

983
00:47:23.286 --> 00:47:26.746 A:middle
the exact same concepts, as
when editing a photo using the

984
00:47:26.746 --> 00:47:29.986 A:middle
photo's framework just here
wrapped slightly differently

985
00:47:29.986 --> 00:47:31.776 A:middle
for the specific
needs of an extension.

986
00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:37.256 A:middle
So, you would typically
read out the input image.

987
00:47:37.676 --> 00:47:39.236 A:middle
In this particular case
we're going to work

988
00:47:39.236 --> 00:47:40.876 A:middle
with a display-size
representation.

989
00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:43.146 A:middle
We don't need the full-size
image right away here.

990
00:47:43.836 --> 00:47:46.716 A:middle
Then we're going to decode
any input.adjustmentData

991
00:47:47.226 --> 00:47:50.076 A:middle
or fall back to some default
settings if there's none.

992
00:47:51.156 --> 00:47:55.526 A:middle
Then you set up your user
interface the way you need it.

993
00:47:55.526 --> 00:47:57.486 A:middle
And you typically find
it's usefully to hold

994
00:47:57.486 --> 00:47:59.566 A:middle
on to the input object
that was given to you.

995
00:48:00.316 --> 00:48:03.396 A:middle
Now the user will interact
with your extension.

996
00:48:03.626 --> 00:48:06.846 A:middle
And when the user is done, the
second method will be called.

997
00:48:07.616 --> 00:48:09.386 A:middle
And this is when your extension,

998
00:48:09.746 --> 00:48:13.796 A:middle
we need to provide the final
output data and hand it back.

999
00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:17.406 A:middle
Second implementation
can look like this.

1000
00:48:18.286 --> 00:48:20.976 A:middle
For images, you drag
a JPEG representation

1001
00:48:20.976 --> 00:48:23.706 A:middle
of the full-size image with
your effects applied to it.

1002
00:48:24.396 --> 00:48:26.466 A:middle
You still create this
adjustment's data object

1003
00:48:26.466 --> 00:48:30.026 A:middle
which describe whatever you've
applied to the input image.

1004
00:48:30.716 --> 00:48:32.266 A:middle
And then you create
an output object

1005
00:48:32.266 --> 00:48:34.026 A:middle
that wraps all this information.

1006
00:48:34.506 --> 00:48:36.676 A:middle
And when you're done, you
call the completionHandler.

1007
00:48:39.036 --> 00:48:42.736 A:middle
You notice in this example
that the flow is synchronous,

1008
00:48:42.996 --> 00:48:43.856 A:middle
but it doesn't have to be.

1009
00:48:44.256 --> 00:48:46.196 A:middle
If you prefer to have an
asynchronous workflow,

1010
00:48:46.196 --> 00:48:46.946 A:middle
it's totally fine.

1011
00:48:47.226 --> 00:48:49.156 A:middle
You just have to call
the completionHandler

1012
00:48:49.546 --> 00:48:50.946 A:middle
when your output is ready.

1013
00:48:55.296 --> 00:48:59.206 A:middle
Now you remember the story
about resuming editing.

1014
00:48:59.496 --> 00:49:03.736 A:middle
So we imagine that the user
selects your extension using an

1015
00:49:03.736 --> 00:49:06.086 A:middle
image or a video that
already has been edited

1016
00:49:06.086 --> 00:49:07.696 A:middle
and that has some
adjustments data.

1017
00:49:08.766 --> 00:49:11.766 A:middle
You remember the first
question that we asked you is,

1018
00:49:12.106 --> 00:49:16.206 A:middle
do you understand that given the
existing adjustment data on it,

1019
00:49:16.206 --> 00:49:18.996 A:middle
and that way we can provide
you with the appropriate input.

1020
00:49:19.596 --> 00:49:26.356 A:middle
And this is when this method can
handle adjustments data is going

1021
00:49:26.356 --> 00:49:28.016 A:middle
to get called a new extension.

1022
00:49:28.576 --> 00:49:32.706 A:middle
And, typically, implementation
could be as simple

1023
00:49:32.706 --> 00:49:36.926 A:middle
as checking whether you support
the formatIdentifier and version

1024
00:49:36.926 --> 00:49:38.956 A:middle
of this adjustment data.

1025
00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:42.596 A:middle
And, finally, the last
method pretty obviously is

1026
00:49:42.596 --> 00:49:45.056 A:middle
when the user cancels
your extension.

1027
00:49:45.936 --> 00:49:47.766 A:middle
One thing to notice,
which isn't obvious,

1028
00:49:47.766 --> 00:49:50.126 A:middle
is that this method can
be called at any time.

1029
00:49:50.906 --> 00:49:53.616 A:middle
So, for example, if your
extension requires some time

1030
00:49:53.616 --> 00:49:54.606 A:middle
to produce the output --

1031
00:49:55.026 --> 00:49:56.546 A:middle
for example, you're
editing a video --

1032
00:49:56.546 --> 00:49:59.946 A:middle
the user could decide
to interrupt you

1033
00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:00.976 A:middle
and cancel right
away at any time.
