00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:10.616 A:middle
[ Pause ]

2
00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:13.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to
Advanced Media for the Web.

3
00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:15.676 A:middle
My name is Jer Noble
and I'm an engineer

4
00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:17.576 A:middle
on the Safari Layout
and Rendering Team.

5
00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:20.326 A:middle
And today we're going to talk
about what's new with audio

6
00:00:20.326 --> 00:00:23.836 A:middle
and video in Safari and
how media integrates

7
00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.196 A:middle
with today's modern web.

8
00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:29.286 A:middle
So this is the &lt;video&gt;
element, it's the heart

9
00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:31.006 A:middle
and soul of web-based media.

10
00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:35.356 A:middle
On one hand it's a container for
some truly advanced technology,

11
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.676 A:middle
but &lt;video&gt; elements are also
just another brick in the DOM.

12
00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:42.866 A:middle
They can participate in
layout and rendering.

13
00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:47.766 A:middle
They can be styled with CSS.

14
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.966 A:middle
With the &lt;video&gt; element,
media can now be integrated

15
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.476 A:middle
into the same responsive,

16
00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:53.996 A:middle
dynamic designs being
written for the modern web.

17
00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:57.356 A:middle
Video now helps tell
stories rather

18
00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.566 A:middle
than being the story itself.

19
00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.886 A:middle
A modern example, such as New
York Times' snowfall article,

20
00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:04.206 A:middle
show how you can weave video

21
00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.616 A:middle
into a rich storytelling
experience.

22
00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:10.236 A:middle
And video can add emotion
and energy to a page,

23
00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.116 A:middle
even to something already as
exciting as the new Mac Pro.

24
00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:15.646 A:middle
And it can still
take center stage.

25
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.006 A:middle
But things weren't
always this easy.

26
00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:19.616 A:middle
Let's take a look back

27
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:21.856 A:middle
at how the &lt;video&gt;
element became a part

28
00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:24.076 A:middle
of this exciting modern web.

29
00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:28.796 A:middle
So in 1999 this was how you
added video to your website.

30
00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:30.556 A:middle
The QuickTime plug-in,

31
00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:33.096 A:middle
and at the time the
QuickTime plug-in was amazing.

32
00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:35.696 A:middle
It could decode high
bit rate video

33
00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:38.186 A:middle
and it exposed a rich
API to JavaScript.

34
00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.526 A:middle
For a while, plug-ins
were the only way

35
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.776 A:middle
to add video to your website.

36
00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:45.176 A:middle
Now fast forward seven years

37
00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:48.656 A:middle
and in 2006 this was how you
added video to your website:

38
00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:50.776 A:middle
the QuickTime plug-in, again.

39
00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:55.676 A:middle
By now the QuickTime plug-in
supported the H.264 codec

40
00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:58.166 A:middle
and it delivered even
higher quality video,

41
00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:01.046 A:middle
but it was still a
plug-in, one which users had

42
00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.296 A:middle
to find, download and install.

43
00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:07.386 A:middle
Well, not you Mac users, of
course, but it wasn't something

44
00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:10.306 A:middle
which website authors could
depend upon being available

45
00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:12.066 A:middle
across all their
entire audience.

46
00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:15.486 A:middle
In 2007, though,
this all changed

47
00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:17.416 A:middle
when the &lt;video&gt;
tag was introduced.

48
00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:19.456 A:middle
This was an amazing
breakthrough.

49
00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:21.276 A:middle
No longer did web
developers have

50
00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:23.206 A:middle
to depend upon a
proprietary plug-in

51
00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:24.656 A:middle
to deliver video in their pages.

52
00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:27.916 A:middle
Video is now integrated
directly into the web layer,

53
00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:32.606 A:middle
and as an HTML5 specification
the &lt;video&gt; element provided a

54
00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:35.146 A:middle
constant or a consistent
experience in API

55
00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:37.196 A:middle
across all browsers
and platforms.

56
00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:41.356 A:middle
Browsers could build on,
improve and add video features

57
00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:43.006 A:middle
without waiting for
plug-in developers,

58
00:02:43.116 --> 00:02:45.516 A:middle
and this triggered a
virtuous cycle of innovation.

59
00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:53.516 A:middle
In 2009 the &lt;video&gt; tag came to
mobile browsers in iPhone OS 3,

60
00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:56.056 A:middle
when support for the &lt;video&gt;
element was added to Safari.

61
00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:59.996 A:middle
Previously, the primary way
users of Safari would interact

62
00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:02.546 A:middle
with a video was by clicking
on a YouTube.com link,

63
00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:04.156 A:middle
which would open
up the YouTube app,

64
00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:07.036 A:middle
but now video was a
first class member

65
00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:08.406 A:middle
of mobile browsers as well.

66
00:03:08.786 --> 00:03:13.786 A:middle
And today's iOS devices
are almost as powerful,

67
00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:18.616 A:middle
if not more powerful than
desktop computers sold in 2009.

68
00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:22.136 A:middle
We've talked a lot about the
&lt;video&gt; element at past WWDCs.

69
00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.826 A:middle
All the videos are at
developer.apple.com

70
00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:27.096 A:middle
or on the WWDC app you
have on your phone.

71
00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:30.966 A:middle
In 2010 we covered the basics

72
00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:33.566 A:middle
of adding a &lt;video&gt;
element to your web page.

73
00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:37.126 A:middle
In 2011 we talked about how
to take that &lt;video&gt; element

74
00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:38.846 A:middle
and add CSS and JavaScript

75
00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:41.116 A:middle
to make your own custom
media controllers.

76
00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:43.516 A:middle
And in 2012 we showed you how

77
00:03:43.516 --> 00:03:45.666 A:middle
to play back multiple
media elements synchronized

78
00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:49.846 A:middle
with one another, how to do
advanced low latency effects

79
00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:51.756 A:middle
with the web audio API and how

80
00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:54.606 A:middle
to take your JavaScript-based
controls into full screen

81
00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:56.306 A:middle
with the full screen API.

82
00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:00.676 A:middle
So what will you
learn at WWDC 2014?

83
00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:04.876 A:middle
You'll learn how we've narrowed
the differences between Safari

84
00:04:04.976 --> 00:04:07.196 A:middle
on iOS and Safari
on OS X and what

85
00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.536 A:middle
that means for your web pages.

86
00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:12.196 A:middle
You'll learn the best way
to stream adaptive media

87
00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:16.606 A:middle
on your websites,
how to use less power

88
00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:19.336 A:middle
when playing back video and how

89
00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:21.986 A:middle
to coordinate your media's
timeline with elements

90
00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:23.926 A:middle
in your page with a
timed metadata API.

91
00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:26.546 A:middle
But before we get started,

92
00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:28.686 A:middle
let's talk a little
bit about plug-ins.

93
00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:33.616 A:middle
Now how good is the
&lt;video&gt; element on iOS?

94
00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:37.276 A:middle
It is so good that whenever
I encounter a page on Safari

95
00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:40.626 A:middle
on OS X that insists that I
need to use the Flash plug-in

96
00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:43.046 A:middle
to view its content,
the first thing I try is

97
00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:44.616 A:middle
to turn the user agent to iPad.

98
00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:46.866 A:middle
Most of the time it works.

99
00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:48.616 A:middle
What's that all about?

100
00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:53.046 A:middle
Well, I know that no one here
would deliberately write a page

101
00:04:53.046 --> 00:04:57.586 A:middle
that insisted on using a plug-in
when HTML5 video was available.

102
00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:59.746 A:middle
I'm just going to assume
you've updated your iPad sites

103
00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:02.836 A:middle
recently, but please update
your desktop site as well.

104
00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.096 A:middle
Plug-ins have a time
and a place,

105
00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:08.146 A:middle
but as web standards
evolve and browsers improve,

106
00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:11.366 A:middle
those times are getting fewer
and the places further between,

107
00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:14.596 A:middle
and that's a good thing.

108
00:05:14.716 --> 00:05:16.026 A:middle
So speaking of browsers
improving,

109
00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:17.806 A:middle
let's talk about how we've
narrowed the differences

110
00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:22.966 A:middle
between Safari on iOS and OS X.

111
00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:24.436 A:middle
We've removed some
of the distinctions

112
00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:27.006 A:middle
between the platforms by
giving you more control

113
00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:29.996 A:middle
over media loading with the
preload attribute on iOS

114
00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.886 A:middle
and by allowing the
&lt;video&gt; element

115
00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:35.076 A:middle
to fully participate
in CSS layering.

116
00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:39.596 A:middle
But first the preload attribute.

117
00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:43.326 A:middle
The &lt;video&gt; element's preload
attribute lets page authors

118
00:05:43.466 --> 00:05:46.316 A:middle
control when and how their
media's data is loaded.

119
00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:50.196 A:middle
A preload value of "none"
instructs the browser

120
00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:51.906 A:middle
to preload no metadata.

121
00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:55.536 A:middle
A value of "metadata"
asks the browser

122
00:05:55.536 --> 00:05:57.786 A:middle
to only download
enough media data

123
00:05:57.786 --> 00:06:02.336 A:middle
to determine the media's width,
height, duration et cetera.

124
00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:06.886 A:middle
And a value of "auto" means
begin loading media data

125
00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:08.436 A:middle
sufficient to begin playback.

126
00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:13.216 A:middle
Now in the early days of
iOS, there was a lot of media

127
00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:15.746 A:middle
on the internet which couldn't
be played by iOS devices.

128
00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:19.666 A:middle
So in order to be able to
tell users whether the media

129
00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:21.276 A:middle
in the page was playable or not,

130
00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:24.856 A:middle
Safari would download enough
media data to check playability.

131
00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:27.726 A:middle
But in order to keep
users' data costs down,

132
00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:30.686 A:middle
it would ignore the
preload attribute and behave

133
00:06:30.686 --> 00:06:32.176 A:middle
as if it was set
to preload="none".

134
00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:36.726 A:middle
In 2014, unplayable web media
is much less of a problem,

135
00:06:37.176 --> 00:06:40.986 A:middle
so new in iOS 8, Safari will
honor two preload values:

136
00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:45.596 A:middle
"metadata", which is the
new default, and "none".

137
00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:47.386 A:middle
Why is this the right
thing to do?

138
00:06:47.986 --> 00:06:51.986 A:middle
Most sites will see no change in
behavior, either in the browser

139
00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:58.016 A:middle
or on their server, but even
loading just metadata can load

140
00:06:58.016 --> 00:07:00.196 A:middle
up for sites with a lot
of &lt;video&gt; elements.

141
00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:03.596 A:middle
So now the preload value
of "none" will be honored.

142
00:07:03.596 --> 00:07:08.926 A:middle
Now it's still true that on iOS
loading beyond metadata will

143
00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:11.796 A:middle
still require user interaction,
and we still believe

144
00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:15.836 A:middle
that this restriction is in
the user's best interest,

145
00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:19.366 A:middle
but it does get rid of one
frustrating distinction

146
00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:21.546 A:middle
between Safari on OS X and iOS.

147
00:07:23.846 --> 00:07:25.446 A:middle
So why is this important?

148
00:07:26.106 --> 00:07:29.366 A:middle
For &lt;video&gt; elements which
don't explicitly specify preload

149
00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.566 A:middle
of "none", they will begin
admitting new events,

150
00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:34.396 A:middle
specifically the
"loadedmetadata" event.

151
00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:38.206 A:middle
Now, during development, we
came across a certain site,

152
00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:40.336 A:middle
which had the following
on their mobile page.

153
00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:44.806 A:middle
They had a &lt;video&gt; element with
default controls enabled that,

154
00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:46.606 A:middle
when it receives
the loaded metadata,

155
00:07:46.606 --> 00:07:48.426 A:middle
the event would hide
those controls.

156
00:07:48.626 --> 00:07:53.546 A:middle
And it did so to enforce users
watching their pre-roll ads.

157
00:07:54.946 --> 00:07:58.756 A:middle
So in iOS 7, when the
&lt;video&gt; element was shown,

158
00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:00.906 A:middle
nothing would happen.

159
00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:03.686 A:middle
And when they hit "play",
loading would progress,

160
00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:05.546 A:middle
the loaded metadata
then would fire

161
00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:06.426 A:middle
and the controls would hide.

162
00:08:08.236 --> 00:08:11.286 A:middle
In iOS 8, as soon as the
video was added to the page,

163
00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:14.246 A:middle
loading would begin, the loaded
metadata event would fire,

164
00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:16.536 A:middle
and the controls would hide,
leaving the users no way

165
00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:18.056 A:middle
of actually playing the video.

166
00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:20.976 A:middle
Now how could they fix this?

167
00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:24.106 A:middle
What they shouldn't do is
revert to the old behavior

168
00:08:24.106 --> 00:08:26.536 A:middle
by adding preload="none",
that just leaves

169
00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:27.986 A:middle
in place the implicit assumption

170
00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:31.406 A:middle
that loadedmetadata means
the video has begun playing.

171
00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:34.076 A:middle
Instead they should
listen for the onplay event

172
00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:37.976 A:middle
and hide the controls when that
occurs, letting the users play.

173
00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:44.256 A:middle
So that's new in loading.

174
00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:47.546 A:middle
Let's talk about layering.

175
00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:51.306 A:middle
In previous versions of iOS, the
&lt;video&gt; element was implemented

176
00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:55.006 A:middle
as a UI view, which was
placed on top of web content.

177
00:08:56.986 --> 00:09:00.736 A:middle
New in iOS 8, we have integrated
in the &lt;video&gt; element directly

178
00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:02.186 A:middle
as a native part of
the rendered tree,

179
00:09:02.286 --> 00:09:04.026 A:middle
just as it is on OS X Safari.

180
00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:07.836 A:middle
And, as a result, the &lt;video&gt;
element will now fully respect

181
00:09:07.836 --> 00:09:08.766 A:middle
CSS layering rules.

182
00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:13.236 A:middle
However, there is a caveat:

183
00:09:14.056 --> 00:09:17.016 A:middle
websites which did not
exclusively place their video

184
00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:20.086 A:middle
topmost with the CSS
z-index property may see some

185
00:09:20.086 --> 00:09:21.016 A:middle
weird behavior.

186
00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:23.796 A:middle
They could have their video
appear below other layers

187
00:09:23.826 --> 00:09:25.186 A:middle
that it didn't appear
below before.

188
00:09:25.796 --> 00:09:28.066 A:middle
Or other layers appearing
transparently on top

189
00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:30.876 A:middle
of the video layer could
intercept touch events,

190
00:09:31.096 --> 00:09:31.976 A:middle
leaving the users no way

191
00:09:31.976 --> 00:09:33.746 A:middle
of actually playing the
video in that case either.

192
00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:35.166 A:middle
So please be on the lookout

193
00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:37.946 A:middle
for these breaking
changes in your websites.

194
00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:39.386 A:middle
That was platform differences.

195
00:09:39.386 --> 00:09:40.986 A:middle
Now let's talk about
how the best way

196
00:09:40.986 --> 00:09:43.226 A:middle
to add adaptive streaming
to your websites.

197
00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:46.006 A:middle
So today's web devices
run the gamut

198
00:09:46.006 --> 00:09:48.276 A:middle
from small battery-powered
mobile devices,

199
00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:50.786 A:middle
to desktop computers,
to big screen TVs.

200
00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:54.696 A:middle
And that has led to a movement
called responsive web design,

201
00:09:55.266 --> 00:09:57.836 A:middle
whose goal is to provide an
optimal viewing experience

202
00:09:57.836 --> 00:10:02.396 A:middle
across a wide variety of devices
by tailoring a page to respond

203
00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:04.256 A:middle
to different characteristics
of the device

204
00:10:04.256 --> 00:10:04.966 A:middle
on which it's running.

205
00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:11.026 A:middle
Now most responsive web design
concerns itself with the size

206
00:10:11.026 --> 00:10:12.956 A:middle
of the viewport in
which the page is shown.

207
00:10:12.956 --> 00:10:17.976 A:middle
But, for video, other properties
of the device are as important.

208
00:10:18.936 --> 00:10:23.346 A:middle
So, yes, what screen size
is available on your device,

209
00:10:23.566 --> 00:10:26.576 A:middle
but also what video resolution
can the device decode?

210
00:10:27.136 --> 00:10:29.826 A:middle
What codecs and profiles
does the device support?

211
00:10:30.416 --> 00:10:32.936 A:middle
And how much bandwidth
does the device's internet

212
00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:33.746 A:middle
connection provide?

213
00:10:35.776 --> 00:10:38.286 A:middle
At its most basic, a
&lt;video&gt; element points

214
00:10:38.286 --> 00:10:39.956 A:middle
to a single file
on a web server.

215
00:10:40.426 --> 00:10:43.606 A:middle
With only a single file,
a page author is left

216
00:10:43.606 --> 00:10:46.046 A:middle
with the unenviable task
of picking a single version

217
00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:48.046 A:middle
that will apply to
all of their viewers.

218
00:10:50.356 --> 00:10:52.076 A:middle
So perhaps a desktop device

219
00:10:52.076 --> 00:10:55.166 A:middle
with a fat internet connection
should get a high bit rate

220
00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:59.456 A:middle
stream, while a mobile
device on wireless

221
00:10:59.456 --> 00:11:03.576 A:middle
or on cellular might need a
small, lower bit rate version.

222
00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:06.206 A:middle
But that same device,
plugged in and on Wi-Fi,

223
00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:07.896 A:middle
should get the large
bit rate version, too.

224
00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:09.946 A:middle
None of this is easy

225
00:11:09.946 --> 00:11:11.576 A:middle
with a single file
sitting on your server.

226
00:11:12.686 --> 00:11:16.236 A:middle
Instead, this is a job for
HTTP Live Streaming, or HLS.

227
00:11:16.236 --> 00:11:20.346 A:middle
So HTTP Live Streaming
is a mechanism

228
00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:24.226 A:middle
for delivering multiple streams
in a single manifest file.

229
00:11:25.366 --> 00:11:28.126 A:middle
The master playlist,
or manifest,

230
00:11:28.256 --> 00:11:31.346 A:middle
describes the characteristics
of each substream and the URL

231
00:11:31.346 --> 00:11:33.026 A:middle
where that stream
can be accessed.

232
00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:36.316 A:middle
And the browser picks the
appropriate stream based

233
00:11:36.316 --> 00:11:38.236 A:middle
on the characteristics
of the current device.

234
00:11:39.246 --> 00:11:45.446 A:middle
Now Safari on OS X and iOS use
the AV Foundation Framework

235
00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:49.526 A:middle
to play HLS streams so you get
the same high quality streaming

236
00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:50.926 A:middle
experience as the native apps.

237
00:11:50.996 --> 00:11:54.276 A:middle
And AV Foundation will
seamlessly switch streams

238
00:11:54.596 --> 00:11:57.026 A:middle
when conditions of the
network or the device change.

239
00:11:58.546 --> 00:12:01.626 A:middle
To show you how easy it is
to create an HLS playlist

240
00:12:01.626 --> 00:12:03.666 A:middle
with multiple streams of
different characteristics,

241
00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:05.286 A:middle
my colleague, Brent Fulgham,

242
00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:06.406 A:middle
will walk you through
the process.

243
00:12:07.346 --> 00:12:07.606 A:middle
Brent?

244
00:12:09.736 --> 00:12:10.326 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jer.

245
00:12:11.416 --> 00:12:14.056 A:middle
My name is Brent Fuljam,
and I'm also an engineer

246
00:12:14.056 --> 00:12:15.706 A:middle
in the WebKit Layout
and Rendering Team.

247
00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:22.046 A:middle
And today I wanted to show
you a few examples of HLS

248
00:12:22.226 --> 00:12:24.556 A:middle
and how it might make
your life better.

249
00:12:26.096 --> 00:12:28.436 A:middle
Now I'm sure that,
getting up here,

250
00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:31.626 A:middle
the first thing you thought
was, "This guy is a skater."

251
00:12:32.216 --> 00:12:33.956 A:middle
Right? I mean, I love it.

252
00:12:34.256 --> 00:12:39.576 A:middle
I film it and I had some great
video that I wanted to show off

253
00:12:40.266 --> 00:12:41.506 A:middle
that we filmed in Utah.

254
00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:45.416 A:middle
It's high-fidelity video,
beautiful cinematography,

255
00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:46.666 A:middle
if I do say so myself.

256
00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:49.996 A:middle
Wonderful, wonderful content.

257
00:12:49.996 --> 00:12:53.166 A:middle
And I wanted to share this
with my friends and family,

258
00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:54.506 A:middle
who couldn't be there that day.

259
00:12:54.906 --> 00:12:58.296 A:middle
So what I wanted to do
was put together a website

260
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:02.616 A:middle
that would show this content.

261
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:06.146 A:middle
Let me return to this.

262
00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:10.326 A:middle
All right, so now I have a
single source element playing

263
00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:10.846 A:middle
a video.

264
00:13:10.846 --> 00:13:13.756 A:middle
This is the content
that I showed you

265
00:13:13.756 --> 00:13:15.636 A:middle
in QuickTime Player
just a second ago.

266
00:13:16.576 --> 00:13:17.716 A:middle
And let's take a look at what

267
00:13:17.716 --> 00:13:19.976 A:middle
that would look like
for our viewers.

268
00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:22.756 A:middle
Great, it looks exactly
the same as what I did

269
00:13:22.756 --> 00:13:26.236 A:middle
in QuickTime Player,
so I'm done, right?

270
00:13:26.236 --> 00:13:29.426 A:middle
All my friends can look at this
and tell me how great I am?

271
00:13:30.026 --> 00:13:33.476 A:middle
Well, no, it turns out that a
number of people were trying

272
00:13:33.476 --> 00:13:36.916 A:middle
to view this with lower
resolution devices: iPhones

273
00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:42.336 A:middle
and iPads and things that don't
have the full pixel content

274
00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:45.796 A:middle
of a giant display
projection system like this.

275
00:13:46.216 --> 00:13:48.116 A:middle
And it turns out they
didn't even watch it

276
00:13:48.116 --> 00:13:50.196 A:middle
because it just took
too long to play.

277
00:13:50.966 --> 00:13:53.196 A:middle
Going back to the original
video, we can kind of see why

278
00:13:53.196 --> 00:13:57.766 A:middle
that is, it's about 150
megabytes for eight seconds

279
00:13:57.806 --> 00:14:02.036 A:middle
of video, and that's not
going to make many people want

280
00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:04.256 A:middle
to stick around and
wait for that.

281
00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:04.906 A:middle
So what do I do?

282
00:14:04.906 --> 00:14:07.616 A:middle
Well, the first thing
I would want

283
00:14:07.616 --> 00:14:10.376 A:middle
to do is take this
original video

284
00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:13.956 A:middle
and create multiple encodings
that are targeted or optimized

285
00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:14.906 A:middle
for different devices.

286
00:14:14.906 --> 00:14:18.526 A:middle
So if I have iPhones and
iPads that I want to support,

287
00:14:18.526 --> 00:14:22.116 A:middle
I want video streams
that are more suitable

288
00:14:22.116 --> 00:14:23.236 A:middle
or optimized for that.

289
00:14:23.656 --> 00:14:26.366 A:middle
And so you could do this
using a variety of tools.

290
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.996 A:middle
We have iMovie; we
have Final Cut Pro.

291
00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:31.766 A:middle
If you're doing a lot of
these you might want to look

292
00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:33.666 A:middle
into Compressor, which
is a great application

293
00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:34.346 A:middle
for doing this.

294
00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:38.416 A:middle
We all have QuickTime Player
installed on our computers,

295
00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:40.976 A:middle
and so let me just show
you what we would do here.

296
00:14:40.976 --> 00:14:44.346 A:middle
In QuickTime Player,
we can export the video

297
00:14:44.596 --> 00:14:45.686 A:middle
in a variety of formats.

298
00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:50.666 A:middle
So we have 1080p, 720p, and
we have a set of presets

299
00:14:51.576 --> 00:14:54.466 A:middle
that are already laid out for
different types of devices.

300
00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:58.186 A:middle
And so in QuickTime Player
I would have to go to each

301
00:14:58.186 --> 00:15:02.556 A:middle
of these presets individually
and output a 1080p version

302
00:15:03.266 --> 00:15:07.736 A:middle
and output an iPhone 3GS
version, and so forth.

303
00:15:07.736 --> 00:15:09.606 A:middle
Now I'm not going
to make you wait

304
00:15:09.606 --> 00:15:14.056 A:middle
around while I export
these, since that's boring,

305
00:15:14.056 --> 00:15:18.906 A:middle
but what I will show
you is the set

306
00:15:18.906 --> 00:15:23.426 A:middle
of video encodings
that I wound up with.

307
00:15:23.486 --> 00:15:28.776 A:middle
And since I was running through
this briefly before we did this,

308
00:15:28.776 --> 00:15:31.116 A:middle
I have stuff here that
you don't need to see yet.

309
00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:33.536 A:middle
All right, so I have these video
encodings, I've created a bunch

310
00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:35.806 A:middle
of different versions that
support the different types

311
00:15:35.806 --> 00:15:39.466 A:middle
of devices that I
want to support.

312
00:15:39.466 --> 00:15:43.696 A:middle
I've got high resolution
for broadband users.

313
00:15:43.696 --> 00:15:46.176 A:middle
I've got lower resolutions
for people on cellular.

314
00:15:46.176 --> 00:15:48.946 A:middle
I've got a broadband
Wi-Fi version.

315
00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:52.106 A:middle
And so now I'm all set.

316
00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:54.276 A:middle
Once I've uploaded
these to the web server,

317
00:15:55.546 --> 00:15:57.416 A:middle
then I'm pretty much
ready to go, except I need

318
00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:59.006 A:middle
to make some changes
to my webpage.

319
00:15:59.616 --> 00:16:03.386 A:middle
So if I go back to
my web page example,

320
00:16:04.556 --> 00:16:08.816 A:middle
instead of just having
this one &lt;video&gt; element

321
00:16:08.816 --> 00:16:12.006 A:middle
or this one video
&lt;source&gt; element

322
00:16:12.006 --> 00:16:15.616 A:middle
that is giving me my
high-quality video

323
00:16:15.616 --> 00:16:20.556 A:middle
or my ProRes video, I
need to add a version

324
00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:24.416 A:middle
that supports, say, my iPad Air.

325
00:16:24.856 --> 00:16:26.646 A:middle
So I have a Retina iPad.

326
00:16:26.966 --> 00:16:31.976 A:middle
I have a source that is a
slightly different location,

327
00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:34.436 A:middle
a different file encoding,

328
00:16:34.436 --> 00:16:36.406 A:middle
so in this case I'm
driving the broadband media,

329
00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:43.776 A:middle
and I'm using a CSS media
selector that limits the clients

330
00:16:43.776 --> 00:16:47.756 A:middle
that are going to receive this
video to items that have a 1024

331
00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:50.696 A:middle
by 768 resolution, like
you would have on an iPad,

332
00:16:50.696 --> 00:16:52.336 A:middle
and a device pixel ratio of 2.

333
00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:56.876 A:middle
And so I say, "Okay, this is my
iPad Air and, while I'm at it,

334
00:16:56.876 --> 00:17:01.226 A:middle
I probably want to have
something for iPhones 5 and 5S

335
00:17:01.926 --> 00:17:04.165 A:middle
and maybe something for
a bunch of older stuff.

336
00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:10.705 A:middle
And pretty soon we have a pretty
large set of sources for us

337
00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:12.935 A:middle
to serve from this web server.

338
00:17:13.316 --> 00:17:21.356 A:middle
Okay, so if we look at this
now, you refresh the page,

339
00:17:22.356 --> 00:17:23.036 A:middle
what does it look like?

340
00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:27.756 A:middle
Well, it looks exactly the same.

341
00:17:27.996 --> 00:17:29.746 A:middle
I'm getting the same
stream that I had before

342
00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:33.816 A:middle
because I'm still connecting to
this with a high-quality, well,

343
00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:37.596 A:middle
a loopback network
and I'm showing it

344
00:17:37.596 --> 00:17:39.406 A:middle
on a giant screen
with lots of pixels.

345
00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:40.936 A:middle
I'm still getting
what I expected.

346
00:17:42.316 --> 00:17:43.456 A:middle
So I should be done now, right?

347
00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:45.636 A:middle
I mean I'm able to
deliver the right content

348
00:17:45.636 --> 00:17:47.506 A:middle
to all these different
people on different devices.

349
00:17:48.156 --> 00:17:49.906 A:middle
Time to go home and
put my feet up

350
00:17:49.906 --> 00:17:52.336 A:middle
and get the congratulatory
e-mails

351
00:17:52.336 --> 00:17:53.736 A:middle
from everyone, I assume, right?

352
00:17:54.766 --> 00:17:55.816 A:middle
Well, it turns

353
00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:58.456 A:middle
out my brother-in-law was
camping the weekend I posted

354
00:17:58.456 --> 00:18:02.266 A:middle
this and had really spotty
internet connectivity.

355
00:18:02.266 --> 00:18:04.306 A:middle
He was, I think, on the
Edge network or something.

356
00:18:04.356 --> 00:18:07.186 A:middle
So I asked him what he thought
of it, and he said, "Well,

357
00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:10.016 A:middle
I didn't even bother watching
it because it took too long

358
00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:13.156 A:middle
to download and it never
made any progress."

359
00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:17.246 A:middle
And I realized, well, we've
dealt with the resolution here,

360
00:18:17.246 --> 00:18:20.156 A:middle
but we haven't talked, at
all, about network bandwidth,

361
00:18:20.796 --> 00:18:22.566 A:middle
and that plays a role, as well.

362
00:18:23.016 --> 00:18:26.696 A:middle
Now as a web developer what
would we do in this case?

363
00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:32.286 A:middle
I could write some kind of
network sniffing algorithm

364
00:18:32.286 --> 00:18:34.946 A:middle
to try to figure out how
much bandwidth is being used

365
00:18:34.946 --> 00:18:36.886 A:middle
and the download rates
and this, but it seems

366
00:18:36.886 --> 00:18:38.976 A:middle
like that'd be really
hard to do properly

367
00:18:38.976 --> 00:18:40.566 A:middle
and it would be really
easy to get wrong

368
00:18:40.866 --> 00:18:42.656 A:middle
and would have to be maintained.

369
00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.316 A:middle
But what about this
HLS technology

370
00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:47.186 A:middle
that Jer just finished
telling us about?

371
00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:49.386 A:middle
In theory that should
take care of everything.

372
00:18:49.386 --> 00:18:53.276 A:middle
Well, it seems like
a good solution.

373
00:18:54.256 --> 00:18:57.666 A:middle
I already have all my encoded
video here, so there's really --

374
00:18:58.006 --> 00:18:59.516 A:middle
I've already done the hard work

375
00:18:59.516 --> 00:19:00.646 A:middle
of creating the different
encodings

376
00:19:00.646 --> 00:19:03.076 A:middle
for the different device
types, so now all I need

377
00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:10.236 A:middle
to do is generate the HLS
master manifest and information

378
00:19:10.236 --> 00:19:12.476 A:middle
that HLS will use to
display this content.

379
00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:15.916 A:middle
Now to do this we need
to use the dynamic duo

380
00:19:16.136 --> 00:19:20.296 A:middle
of Media File Segmenter and
Variant Playlist Creator.

381
00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:23.196 A:middle
And these are fantastic
tools that you can download

382
00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:29.556 A:middle
from our website but, as you
might imagine from these names,

383
00:19:29.996 --> 00:19:34.416 A:middle
they have a dizzying array
of flags and entry points

384
00:19:34.416 --> 00:19:37.896 A:middle
that you have to provide, and so
it's very difficult to remember.

385
00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:42.386 A:middle
We ended up just creating a
shell script to do this for us.

386
00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:48.666 A:middle
And so let me just put
this up here and, okay,

387
00:19:48.736 --> 00:19:52.116 A:middle
and then let me give you a
minute to write that down?

388
00:19:52.626 --> 00:19:56.456 A:middle
And then-oh, well, that's
probably not a great idea.

389
00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.896 A:middle
How about if you come by
our lab later this week,

390
00:19:58.896 --> 00:20:00.666 A:middle
and we'll be happy to
give you a copy of this?

391
00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:03.426 A:middle
All right, so what does this
look like when we run it?

392
00:20:03.426 --> 00:20:08.446 A:middle
Well, what I do is-I'll run
this, make an HLS script.

393
00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:13.266 A:middle
I'll provide us with-I'll
feed it the input

394
00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:16.076 A:middle
of the various files
that we want to use,

395
00:20:16.076 --> 00:20:17.716 A:middle
and we process each
of the files.

396
00:20:18.306 --> 00:20:19.356 A:middle
And what that ends up looking

397
00:20:19.356 --> 00:20:22.876 A:middle
like is I have this
magic index.m3u8,

398
00:20:22.876 --> 00:20:26.556 A:middle
which is the master manifest
file, and I have a series

399
00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:29.096 A:middle
of transport streams
that have been generated

400
00:20:29.096 --> 00:20:29.976 A:middle
for each of my encodings.

401
00:20:30.736 --> 00:20:36.856 A:middle
So in this case I have a
broadband high-bandwidth rate

402
00:20:37.046 --> 00:20:40.886 A:middle
version of this, and I've done
the same-and the script has done

403
00:20:40.886 --> 00:20:42.526 A:middle
the same thing for all
the different options.

404
00:20:42.526 --> 00:20:47.096 A:middle
So what I need to do is upload
all of this stuff to my website,

405
00:20:47.096 --> 00:20:49.476 A:middle
so I'd upload the
different transport streams

406
00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:53.996 A:middle
in my m3u8 file, and at that
point I'm basically done,

407
00:20:53.996 --> 00:20:57.996 A:middle
except for one change that
I need to make to my video,

408
00:20:58.826 --> 00:20:59.616 A:middle
I mean, to my website.

409
00:20:59.616 --> 00:21:08.906 A:middle
What I need to do is get rid of
all of this stuff, all of it,

410
00:21:08.906 --> 00:21:11.656 A:middle
and replace it with one line,

411
00:21:12.316 --> 00:21:14.296 A:middle
the line that I gave you a
sneak peek of at the beginning.

412
00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:18.986 A:middle
This is the index.m3u8, this
is what we're calling --

413
00:21:19.186 --> 00:21:23.866 A:middle
this is our Manifest, our
Master Manifest file for HLS,

414
00:21:25.116 --> 00:21:29.976 A:middle
and let's just make
this say "best".

415
00:21:33.766 --> 00:21:35.676 A:middle
All right, and let's see
what that looks like.

416
00:21:36.266 --> 00:21:36.926 A:middle
I bet you can guess.

417
00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:43.766 A:middle
It looks exactly the same, but
now we're streaming this content

418
00:21:44.816 --> 00:21:48.176 A:middle
in an adaptive fashion, where
it will change and adapt

419
00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:51.376 A:middle
to the type of devices that
are being used and it'll change

420
00:21:51.376 --> 00:21:52.776 A:middle
and adapt to the
network conditions.

421
00:21:52.996 --> 00:21:56.136 A:middle
So if I were to start playing
this eight-second video

422
00:21:56.536 --> 00:22:01.076 A:middle
and leave the room, in theory,
it would-the speed would drop,

423
00:22:01.076 --> 00:22:05.456 A:middle
it would degrade to a
lower bandwidth version.

424
00:22:05.706 --> 00:22:07.976 A:middle
And if I were to
return to an area

425
00:22:07.976 --> 00:22:10.206 A:middle
where I had high bandwidth
it could then pick it back up

426
00:22:10.206 --> 00:22:13.196 A:middle
and return to this beautiful,
high-resolution imagery.

427
00:22:14.456 --> 00:22:22.116 A:middle
So I think that-so I hope that
this brief demo and this example

428
00:22:22.116 --> 00:22:24.976 A:middle
of how simple it is on your
website will show you why we're

429
00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:27.516 A:middle
so excited about this
technology and why we hope

430
00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:29.706 A:middle
that you'll try it for
your next projects.

431
00:22:31.356 --> 00:22:31.676 A:middle
Thank you.

432
00:22:32.166 --> 00:22:33.086 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Brent.

433
00:22:33.346 --> 00:22:34.526 A:middle
That was great.

434
00:22:35.216 --> 00:22:39.476 A:middle
So for more information about
how to use HTTP Live Streaming

435
00:22:39.476 --> 00:22:41.876 A:middle
and how specifically
to encode your videos

436
00:22:41.876 --> 00:22:44.396 A:middle
for all the wide
variety of iOS devices,

437
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.766 A:middle
take a look at Tech Note 2224,

438
00:22:47.026 --> 00:22:50.216 A:middle
which specifies all the settings
you'd need in Compressor

439
00:22:50.216 --> 00:22:52.706 A:middle
to generate multiple
encodings of your video

440
00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:54.826 A:middle
for a variety of Apple devices.

441
00:22:55.316 --> 00:22:58.166 A:middle
And, also, you can download
the Variant Playlist Creator

442
00:22:58.166 --> 00:23:00.086 A:middle
and Media File Segmenter
Tools as part

443
00:23:00.086 --> 00:23:02.516 A:middle
of the HTTP Live
Streaming toolset

444
00:23:02.676 --> 00:23:04.446 A:middle
from developer.apple.com.

445
00:23:04.696 --> 00:23:06.576 A:middle
And we have a live
streaming developer page,

446
00:23:06.576 --> 00:23:07.836 A:middle
where you can learn
all about HLS

447
00:23:08.136 --> 00:23:10.116 A:middle
in webpages and in native apps.

448
00:23:11.126 --> 00:23:15.676 A:middle
But new in Safari
on OS X is support

449
00:23:15.676 --> 00:23:18.816 A:middle
for a media streaming technology
called Media Source Extensions,

450
00:23:18.816 --> 00:23:19.906 A:middle
or MSE.

451
00:23:20.986 --> 00:23:23.926 A:middle
This is an extension to
the HTML5 specification,

452
00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:27.136 A:middle
where a &lt;video&gt; element
source is replaced

453
00:23:27.136 --> 00:23:31.026 A:middle
by a &lt;mediasource&gt; object,
which requires the page

454
00:23:31.026 --> 00:23:33.966 A:middle
to completely control
loading of media data.

455
00:23:35.266 --> 00:23:39.196 A:middle
Now MSE is primarily
intended for only the largest

456
00:23:39.196 --> 00:23:41.786 A:middle
of video providers, who have
large and complicated CVNs

457
00:23:41.786 --> 00:23:44.586 A:middle
and who need to micromanage
every aspect

458
00:23:44.586 --> 00:23:46.256 A:middle
of their network stack.

459
00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:50.226 A:middle
We built support
for MSE into Safari,

460
00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:52.896 A:middle
but for most websites we
don't actually recommend

461
00:23:52.896 --> 00:23:53.606 A:middle
that you use it.

462
00:23:53.606 --> 00:23:55.836 A:middle
And let's talk a little
bit about why that is.

463
00:23:57.276 --> 00:24:01.836 A:middle
With great power comes great
responsibility-except I remember

464
00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:02.676 A:middle
it being someone else.

465
00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:03.676 A:middle
Oh, that's right.

466
00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:09.346 A:middle
The MSE API will accept
raw data, demux it,

467
00:24:09.426 --> 00:24:11.886 A:middle
parse it into the samples,
decode those samples

468
00:24:11.886 --> 00:24:13.766 A:middle
and cube the samples for
display, but that's it.

469
00:24:13.866 --> 00:24:14.826 A:middle
That's all you get.

470
00:24:15.346 --> 00:24:21.106 A:middle
For everything else, your
website has to do it manually.

471
00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:22.736 A:middle
The browser will not
fetch data for you.

472
00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:26.406 A:middle
It must be fetched explicitly
by your page through XHR.

473
00:24:27.946 --> 00:24:30.546 A:middle
The browser will not
preload metadata for you.

474
00:24:30.546 --> 00:24:31.586 A:middle
You have to do that yourself

475
00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:33.436 A:middle
to make sure playback
buffers don't run dry.

476
00:24:33.786 --> 00:24:35.166 A:middle
And once you've done
these two steps,

477
00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:37.666 A:middle
you will have reproduced
basic video playback,

478
00:24:37.886 --> 00:24:39.786 A:middle
but then again the &lt;video&gt;
element could do that already.

479
00:24:39.856 --> 00:24:42.296 A:middle
For all of the benefits
of streaming media,

480
00:24:43.236 --> 00:24:45.036 A:middle
your page must implement
it manually.

481
00:24:45.596 --> 00:24:49.306 A:middle
So your page must monitor
network conditions to make sure

482
00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:51.396 A:middle
that your user's device can keep

483
00:24:51.396 --> 00:24:52.936 A:middle
up with the bit rate
that you are serving.

484
00:24:54.596 --> 00:24:59.246 A:middle
You also have to monitor whether
your users are dropping frames

485
00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:01.616 A:middle
if their hardware can't keep

486
00:25:01.616 --> 00:25:04.076 A:middle
up with the media
that you are serving.

487
00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:10.226 A:middle
And when conditions change you
have to manually switch streams

488
00:25:10.226 --> 00:25:11.676 A:middle
by pre-fetching and
then starting

489
00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:14.036 A:middle
over for a more appropriate
stream.

490
00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:19.436 A:middle
And you have to do all of this
without detailed information

491
00:25:19.436 --> 00:25:22.456 A:middle
about the current state of
the device whereas, with HLS,

492
00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:26.366 A:middle
it can use its detailed view
over the device's current state

493
00:25:26.366 --> 00:25:28.006 A:middle
to make better adaptation
decisions.

494
00:25:28.626 --> 00:25:31.746 A:middle
So, for example, HLS knows what
other processes might be running

495
00:25:31.746 --> 00:25:34.136 A:middle
on the device and knows
whether the device is

496
00:25:34.136 --> 00:25:36.386 A:middle
on a metered cellular
connection or on Wi-Fi.

497
00:25:36.806 --> 00:25:39.496 A:middle
HLS is aware of the
current battery conditions

498
00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:41.056 A:middle
of the device, and it knows

499
00:25:41.056 --> 00:25:43.386 A:middle
about the current memory
pressure the system is under.

500
00:25:46.396 --> 00:25:49.486 A:middle
So writing an MSE player
involves re-implementing an

501
00:25:49.486 --> 00:25:54.726 A:middle
entire streaming media stack in
JavaScript, whereas HLS has all

502
00:25:54.726 --> 00:25:57.486 A:middle
of this data available
and yet writing a player

503
00:25:57.486 --> 00:25:59.786 A:middle
for HLS requires a
single line of HTML.

504
00:26:00.606 --> 00:26:03.416 A:middle
And what's more MSE is
only available on OS X.

505
00:26:03.576 --> 00:26:05.786 A:middle
So, to reach iOS users,
you're likely to have to set

506
00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:06.946 A:middle
up an HLS stream anyway.

507
00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:10.486 A:middle
For almost every conceivable
situation, HLS is going

508
00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:12.676 A:middle
to be a better choice
for streaming media.

509
00:26:14.516 --> 00:26:16.226 A:middle
Okay, what about
cross-browser support?

510
00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:19.246 A:middle
HLS is supported
across all versions

511
00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:22.736 A:middle
of Safari on iOS and OS X.

512
00:26:22.736 --> 00:26:26.456 A:middle
MSE is only supported
on Safari on OS X.

513
00:26:26.526 --> 00:26:29.356 A:middle
The Android browser and
Android Chrome both support HLS,

514
00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:30.346 A:middle
but not MSE.

515
00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:33.526 A:middle
IE 11 supports MSE, but not HLS.

516
00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:36.716 A:middle
Google Chrome supports
media source extensions,

517
00:26:37.006 --> 00:26:41.016 A:middle
but apparently its developers
are investigating implementing

518
00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:43.126 A:middle
HLS on top of MSE as JavaScript.

519
00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:47.866 A:middle
And Firefox only supports
MSE in its nightly builds,

520
00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:51.976 A:middle
but they are also looking
at adding support for HLS

521
00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:53.536 A:middle
through MSE implementation.

522
00:26:57.276 --> 00:27:01.446 A:middle
So, as you can see, the
web hasn't really settled

523
00:27:01.446 --> 00:27:03.606 A:middle
on a single streaming
media technology yet.

524
00:27:03.756 --> 00:27:05.826 A:middle
So, if you take nothing
else away,

525
00:27:06.376 --> 00:27:08.416 A:middle
for your Safari users, use HLS.

526
00:27:09.726 --> 00:27:11.626 A:middle
Okay, that was streaming,
now let's talk

527
00:27:11.626 --> 00:27:12.976 A:middle
about power efficiency.

528
00:27:14.296 --> 00:27:16.716 A:middle
At Apple we care
deeply about power.

529
00:27:16.856 --> 00:27:19.856 A:middle
We make devices with
simply amazing battery life.

530
00:27:20.276 --> 00:27:24.026 A:middle
But it's not just
about batteries.

531
00:27:24.526 --> 00:27:29.336 A:middle
We care about the impact our
devices have on the environment

532
00:27:29.336 --> 00:27:31.806 A:middle
as a whole, and that's evident

533
00:27:31.956 --> 00:27:33.566 A:middle
in how much performance
we can squeeze

534
00:27:33.566 --> 00:27:35.266 A:middle
out of a single watt
of power use.

535
00:27:36.976 --> 00:27:39.446 A:middle
We've done this through
a combination of hardware

536
00:27:39.446 --> 00:27:43.666 A:middle
and software engineering, but
the last mile is up to you.

537
00:27:46.226 --> 00:27:50.226 A:middle
It's easy to do this wrong and
drain your users' batteries.

538
00:27:50.316 --> 00:27:52.716 A:middle
And a user with a dead
battery is one that's not using

539
00:27:52.716 --> 00:27:53.306 A:middle
your website.

540
00:27:53.456 --> 00:27:57.796 A:middle
So today we're going to show
you how to minimize the amount

541
00:27:57.796 --> 00:28:01.156 A:middle
of power you use when
playing back video in Safari.

542
00:28:02.726 --> 00:28:06.556 A:middle
So, first, we're going to talk
about using fullscreen mode

543
00:28:06.926 --> 00:28:07.926 A:middle
and we're going to talk

544
00:28:07.926 --> 00:28:11.056 A:middle
about how sleep cycles
affect battery life.

545
00:28:12.056 --> 00:28:13.066 A:middle
But, first, fullscreen.

546
00:28:14.076 --> 00:28:15.606 A:middle
It may sound counterintuitive,

547
00:28:16.516 --> 00:28:19.016 A:middle
but going into fullscreen mode
can dramatically reduce the

548
00:28:19.016 --> 00:28:21.196 A:middle
amount of power your
system uses as a whole.

549
00:28:22.006 --> 00:28:25.216 A:middle
Apps which are hidden behind a
fullscreen browser window can go

550
00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:29.016 A:middle
into a low-power mode called
App Nap, and you can learn more

551
00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:31.876 A:middle
about App Nap specifically
at-I believe there's a session

552
00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:36.376 A:middle
on Thursday, something
about programming,

553
00:28:36.636 --> 00:28:38.726 A:middle
low-power programming
and, anyway, look it up.

554
00:28:38.726 --> 00:28:40.346 A:middle
It's Thursday at 10:30.

555
00:28:41.236 --> 00:28:48.576 A:middle
But, in addition, when
the system determines

556
00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:52.206 A:middle
that it can composite video
without-well, it doesn't have

557
00:28:52.206 --> 00:28:54.106 A:middle
to do compositing to
get video on screen,

558
00:28:54.106 --> 00:28:57.156 A:middle
it can go through a low power
mode, but to explain how

559
00:28:57.156 --> 00:28:58.726 A:middle
that works we're
first going to have

560
00:28:58.726 --> 00:29:00.226 A:middle
to talk about pixel formats.

561
00:29:01.746 --> 00:29:04.796 A:middle
So every web developer
should be familiar with RGB.

562
00:29:05.086 --> 00:29:07.556 A:middle
The web platform is
written in RGB values,

563
00:29:07.916 --> 00:29:11.006 A:middle
where every pixel is broken into
a red, green and blue component,

564
00:29:11.356 --> 00:29:13.736 A:middle
and each component is
given eight bits of depth.

565
00:29:15.946 --> 00:29:18.566 A:middle
But video is different,
video is decoded

566
00:29:18.566 --> 00:29:24.296 A:middle
into a pixel format called YUV,
where Y is a luminance plane,

567
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.756 A:middle
and U and V are two
color planes.

568
00:29:27.186 --> 00:29:31.126 A:middle
The Y plane actually encodes
the green and brightness values,

569
00:29:31.476 --> 00:29:34.496 A:middle
and the U and V planes
encode the blue, or the red

570
00:29:34.496 --> 00:29:35.506 A:middle
and the blue, respectively.

571
00:29:35.716 --> 00:29:40.596 A:middle
And typically the Y plane
is given twice as much depth

572
00:29:41.026 --> 00:29:45.296 A:middle
as the U and V planes, which
is why we call it YUV 422

573
00:29:45.296 --> 00:29:47.626 A:middle
or other formats, like YUV 411.

574
00:29:47.846 --> 00:29:51.646 A:middle
All of those describe the ratio
of the bit depths between the Y

575
00:29:51.646 --> 00:29:52.566 A:middle
and the U and V planes.

576
00:29:53.106 --> 00:29:56.126 A:middle
And we give the Y
plane more depth

577
00:29:56.206 --> 00:29:59.896 A:middle
because the human visual system
is much better at distinguishing

578
00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:02.866 A:middle
between values of green and
values of light and dark

579
00:30:03.946 --> 00:30:05.926 A:middle
than it is between
values of red and blue.

580
00:30:06.276 --> 00:30:08.846 A:middle
So if you're a mantis shrimp,
then this makes total sense

581
00:30:08.846 --> 00:30:12.406 A:middle
to you-if you're a mantis
shrimp who longboards, that is.

582
00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:21.386 A:middle
But so YUV 422 only requires
about 16 bits per pixel

583
00:30:22.046 --> 00:30:25.636 A:middle
to encode, whereas an RGB with
an alpha channel requires 32.

584
00:30:26.636 --> 00:30:28.986 A:middle
And since there's typically
less variance in the U

585
00:30:28.986 --> 00:30:31.636 A:middle
and the V planes, they can
be compressed much easier

586
00:30:31.636 --> 00:30:33.746 A:middle
than RGB values.

587
00:30:33.976 --> 00:30:36.976 A:middle
And this is why video
prefers to use YUV over RGB.

588
00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:42.336 A:middle
The side effect, though, of
all these decisions is that,

589
00:30:42.606 --> 00:30:46.006 A:middle
since the web platform was
written in RGB and video was

590
00:30:46.006 --> 00:30:49.006 A:middle
in YUV, we have to convert from
one to the other when we need

591
00:30:49.006 --> 00:30:50.346 A:middle
to draw on top of the video.

592
00:30:50.636 --> 00:30:51.656 A:middle
That's how this works.

593
00:30:51.656 --> 00:30:55.446 A:middle
It's called compositing, where
layers are drawn together,

594
00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:56.716 A:middle
top to bottom, in order

595
00:30:56.716 --> 00:30:59.516 A:middle
to present the actual webpage
your viewers are going to see.

596
00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:02.216 A:middle
So typically it works like this,

597
00:31:02.216 --> 00:31:06.006 A:middle
you start with coded video
frames, you decode those frames

598
00:31:06.216 --> 00:31:13.326 A:middle
into YUV, and then convert them
into RGB, draw your web content

599
00:31:13.326 --> 00:31:15.756 A:middle
on top of them and
then send them

600
00:31:15.756 --> 00:31:17.246 A:middle
out to the video
card to be displayed.

601
00:31:18.686 --> 00:31:19.446 A:middle
Simple, right?

602
00:31:19.446 --> 00:31:22.336 A:middle
Now if the system determines

603
00:31:22.336 --> 00:31:24.106 A:middle
that it can display a
video frame without having

604
00:31:24.106 --> 00:31:27.346 A:middle
to draw anything on top
of it, it can skip all

605
00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:30.096 A:middle
of these format conversion
steps and go straight

606
00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:32.166 A:middle
from YUV directly
to the video card.

607
00:31:34.636 --> 00:31:36.536 A:middle
It dramatically reduces
the amount

608
00:31:36.536 --> 00:31:38.726 A:middle
of power required
to display video.

609
00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:42.056 A:middle
It does have a few
prerequisites, though.

610
00:31:42.286 --> 00:31:44.666 A:middle
For one you must support
the Fullscreen API.

611
00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:47.976 A:middle
If you have JavaScript custom
controls, you should have

612
00:31:47.976 --> 00:31:50.946 A:middle
at least one that uses the
requestFullscreen method

613
00:31:50.946 --> 00:31:56.116 A:middle
to bring your controls and your
video into fullscreen mode.

614
00:31:56.206 --> 00:31:57.636 A:middle
Black is the new black.

615
00:31:58.506 --> 00:32:01.256 A:middle
You should only have a black
background visible behind

616
00:32:01.256 --> 00:32:01.816 A:middle
your video.

617
00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.536 A:middle
And no DOM element should be
visible on top of your video

618
00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:10.196 A:middle
as well, and this is
tricky because elements

619
00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:13.066 A:middle
which have an opacity of zero
are still technically visible.

620
00:32:13.736 --> 00:32:15.516 A:middle
So don't hide your
controls with opacity

621
00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:17.736 A:middle
or at least don't only
hide them with opacity;

622
00:32:17.986 --> 00:32:19.276 A:middle
use "display:none" as well.

623
00:32:22.256 --> 00:32:25.226 A:middle
And everything that's not
currently being displayed

624
00:32:25.226 --> 00:32:28.026 A:middle
in fullscreen mode won't
ever be visible, so you might

625
00:32:28.026 --> 00:32:29.076 A:middle
as well hide it as well.

626
00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:32.106 A:middle
And we'll show you a quick
little snippet of CSS

627
00:32:32.106 --> 00:32:34.626 A:middle
that will hide all of your
non-fullscreen elements

628
00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.886 A:middle
when your video is
in fullscreen mode.

629
00:32:38.076 --> 00:32:39.646 A:middle
So, first, the Fullscreen API.

630
00:32:39.646 --> 00:32:42.086 A:middle
Now we've talked about
this at a previous session,

631
00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:44.876 A:middle
so for more information about
how the Fullscreen API works,

632
00:32:45.326 --> 00:32:47.806 A:middle
check out-I think it's
the 2011 video session.

633
00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.716 A:middle
But, really quickly, if
you just call this method

634
00:32:50.716 --> 00:32:54.476 A:middle
from like a fullscreen button
handler it will toggle back

635
00:32:54.476 --> 00:32:56.146 A:middle
and forth between
fullscreen mode.

636
00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:01.986 A:middle
To hide everything that's
not in fullscreen we're going

637
00:33:01.986 --> 00:33:03.826 A:middle
to give you a little
snippet of CSS to use.

638
00:33:04.446 --> 00:33:06.596 A:middle
So, first, for a
fullscreen element,

639
00:33:06.646 --> 00:33:09.846 A:middle
all of its ancestors are
given a pseudo-class called

640
00:33:09.846 --> 00:33:10.816 A:middle
"full-screen-ancestor".

641
00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:14.556 A:middle
So this will select every child

642
00:33:14.556 --> 00:33:17.446 A:middle
of a fullscreen ancestor
that's not an ancestor itself

643
00:33:17.936 --> 00:33:21.716 A:middle
and is not the fullscreen
element itself, and hide it.

644
00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:28.556 A:middle
So just add this line
of CSS to your websites.

645
00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:32.386 A:middle
None of the objects that are not
in fullscreen mode when the rest

646
00:33:32.386 --> 00:33:35.426 A:middle
of your content is
will be visible or,

647
00:33:35.426 --> 00:33:37.286 A:middle
if they won't be visible, they
won't be in the render tree

648
00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:39.156 A:middle
and wasting CPU cycles
in memory.

649
00:33:41.146 --> 00:33:42.786 A:middle
Okay, so that was compositing.

650
00:33:43.226 --> 00:33:46.766 A:middle
Now let's talk about how video
playback affects your sleep.

651
00:33:47.816 --> 00:33:49.756 A:middle
Something you should
be aware of is the way

652
00:33:49.756 --> 00:33:54.336 A:middle
that media playback affects
your user system's sleep cycles.

653
00:33:54.976 --> 00:33:57.746 A:middle
When Safari plays a video it
will conditionally block the

654
00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:00.106 A:middle
display from sleeping
using a sleep assertion,

655
00:34:00.296 --> 00:34:02.666 A:middle
and it does this to avoid
the annoying behavior

656
00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:05.886 A:middle
of your display going to sleep
halfway through an episode

657
00:34:06.106 --> 00:34:08.136 A:middle
of "Orange Is the New
Black" or whatever.

658
00:34:10.045 --> 00:34:13.136 A:middle
Safari will only block
this sleep from happening

659
00:34:13.216 --> 00:34:14.806 A:middle
under certain conditions,
though.

660
00:34:16.016 --> 00:34:21.016 A:middle
So, the video must have an
audio track and a video track.

661
00:34:21.815 --> 00:34:25.706 A:middle
It has to be playing and
it must not be looping.

662
00:34:25.786 --> 00:34:27.596 A:middle
If any of these conditions
are not met,

663
00:34:27.596 --> 00:34:29.426 A:middle
we won't keep the
system from sleeping.

664
00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:34.956 A:middle
However, this has kind of
a dramatic failure mode.

665
00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:37.525 A:middle
So there was a website
we came across.

666
00:34:38.496 --> 00:34:40.036 A:middle
They were trying to
do something very cool

667
00:34:40.036 --> 00:34:40.896 A:middle
with the &lt;video&gt; elements.

668
00:34:40.896 --> 00:34:44.516 A:middle
They used a full-page &lt;video&gt;
element as the backdrop

669
00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:46.946 A:middle
of their landing page and,

670
00:34:47.196 --> 00:34:49.906 A:middle
in order to do a fancy
CSS transition at the end

671
00:34:49.906 --> 00:34:52.436 A:middle
of the video, they
didn't use looping.

672
00:34:52.585 --> 00:34:57.646 A:middle
They had two &lt;video&gt; elements
that they faded between and,

673
00:34:57.846 --> 00:35:00.416 A:middle
even though their video wasn't
entirely silent, it was silent

674
00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:02.476 A:middle
because it had a
silent audio track.

675
00:35:03.266 --> 00:35:04.996 A:middle
So if you loaded this
page and you walked away

676
00:35:04.996 --> 00:35:07.436 A:middle
from your computer, you
came back in a few hours,

677
00:35:07.436 --> 00:35:11.586 A:middle
it would be completely
dead because, to Safari,

678
00:35:11.586 --> 00:35:14.036 A:middle
this looks like the user
is just watching a playlist

679
00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:14.936 A:middle
of different videos.

680
00:35:15.476 --> 00:35:17.266 A:middle
So how could they fix this?

681
00:35:17.516 --> 00:35:19.456 A:middle
Well, for one they could
strip the audio track,

682
00:35:19.566 --> 00:35:21.436 A:middle
the silent audio track,
out of their media.

683
00:35:22.576 --> 00:35:26.336 A:middle
They could also burn the fade
effect into the video itself,

684
00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:29.286 A:middle
the video media itself,
and use the loop property

685
00:35:29.286 --> 00:35:31.696 A:middle
to loop the video
over and over again.

686
00:35:31.756 --> 00:35:34.156 A:middle
Either one of those would
let the display sleep again.

687
00:35:36.796 --> 00:35:40.556 A:middle
But we have also updated
our requirements in Safari.

688
00:35:40.806 --> 00:35:42.736 A:middle
In addition to the &lt;video&gt;
element having an audio

689
00:35:42.736 --> 00:35:45.276 A:middle
and video track, not
looping, and playing,

690
00:35:45.736 --> 00:35:47.076 A:middle
it must also be visible.

691
00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:49.896 A:middle
That means it must be
in the foreground tab

692
00:35:50.216 --> 00:35:53.496 A:middle
in the visible window
and on the current space.

693
00:35:53.836 --> 00:35:57.606 A:middle
If the &lt;video&gt; element
is in a background tab

694
00:35:57.606 --> 00:36:00.706 A:middle
or the window is hidden, it
will let the system sleep again.

695
00:36:00.866 --> 00:36:03.156 A:middle
So, with these changes, even
if you do the wrong thing,

696
00:36:04.136 --> 00:36:06.586 A:middle
your page will still keep the
system from sleeping but only

697
00:36:06.586 --> 00:36:08.256 A:middle
when your page is
actually visible.

698
00:36:09.326 --> 00:36:10.776 A:middle
Okay, that was power efficiency.

699
00:36:10.956 --> 00:36:13.026 A:middle
Now let's talk about how
to use timed metadata

700
00:36:13.026 --> 00:36:14.636 A:middle
to coordinate events
in your page.

701
00:36:14.996 --> 00:36:16.596 A:middle
So what is timed metadata?

702
00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:20.726 A:middle
Timed metadata is data
delivered alongside your video

703
00:36:20.726 --> 00:36:24.916 A:middle
and your audio data where each
piece of data has a start time

704
00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:27.106 A:middle
and an end time that's
in the media's timeline.

705
00:36:28.246 --> 00:36:31.086 A:middle
But, Jer, I can hear you
asking, that sounds a lot

706
00:36:31.086 --> 00:36:33.086 A:middle
like text tracks,
and that's true.

707
00:36:33.866 --> 00:36:36.396 A:middle
Text tracks are one
kind of timed metadata,

708
00:36:36.396 --> 00:36:39.946 A:middle
but metadata isn't limited to
text and other text-like things.

709
00:36:40.276 --> 00:36:43.116 A:middle
You can include arbitrary
binary information;

710
00:36:43.116 --> 00:36:45.566 A:middle
you can include geolocation
information; you can control,

711
00:36:45.696 --> 00:36:48.436 A:middle
add images, you can
include text;

712
00:36:48.736 --> 00:36:50.986 A:middle
you can include anything
you'd like in a metadata track

713
00:36:51.226 --> 00:36:55.116 A:middle
and have that be available
through the Timed Metadata API.

714
00:36:55.116 --> 00:36:58.916 A:middle
Now, timed metadata has been
available to native apps

715
00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:03.336 A:middle
in API form on iOS and OS X for
some time, but new in Safari

716
00:37:03.336 --> 00:37:07.236 A:middle
on iOS and OS X, it's easy to
use from JavaScript as well.

717
00:37:08.096 --> 00:37:10.296 A:middle
It appears in the &lt;video&gt;
element as a text track,

718
00:37:10.766 --> 00:37:14.636 A:middle
just like the caption tracks we
talked about at previous WWDCs.

719
00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:16.646 A:middle
These tracks will be
a kind of metadata,

720
00:37:16.646 --> 00:37:18.886 A:middle
meaning they won't be
displayed by the browser.

721
00:37:20.116 --> 00:37:23.826 A:middle
Instead they'll be available to
your script running in the page,

722
00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:26.756 A:middle
and you can use the same
Text Track APIs to watch

723
00:37:26.756 --> 00:37:30.626 A:middle
for incoming metadata
events as text track cues.

724
00:37:31.366 --> 00:37:34.156 A:middle
Now TextTrack contains
a list of cues,

725
00:37:34.156 --> 00:37:36.616 A:middle
each one has a start
time and an end time.

726
00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:40.346 A:middle
You can add event
handlers to these objects

727
00:37:40.616 --> 00:37:43.096 A:middle
that will get fired as
the media timeline goes

728
00:37:43.096 --> 00:37:45.486 A:middle
into the cue and leaves.

729
00:37:46.926 --> 00:37:53.626 A:middle
Now a WebKitDataCue is a
subclass of a TextTrackCue and,

730
00:37:53.626 --> 00:37:55.336 A:middle
because this interface
is experimental,

731
00:37:55.556 --> 00:37:56.816 A:middle
it has a WebKit prefix.

732
00:37:57.016 --> 00:38:00.286 A:middle
So this is not in
the HTML5 spec yet.

733
00:38:01.286 --> 00:38:03.616 A:middle
Be prepared for this
interface to change.

734
00:38:03.686 --> 00:38:04.696 A:middle
That said, we're pushing

735
00:38:04.696 --> 00:38:06.776 A:middle
to get these proposed
changes into the spec soon.

736
00:38:08.376 --> 00:38:11.946 A:middle
So each cue will have a type
property, which allows you

737
00:38:11.946 --> 00:38:14.976 A:middle
to interpret the value
property correctly.

738
00:38:15.306 --> 00:38:16.346 A:middle
So what does a type look like?

739
00:38:16.656 --> 00:38:20.046 A:middle
Well, the metadata cue type
indicates the source the

740
00:38:20.076 --> 00:38:21.016 A:middle
metadata came from.

741
00:38:21.276 --> 00:38:23.736 A:middle
So metadata can be found in
QuickTime user data atoms;

742
00:38:24.196 --> 00:38:26.456 A:middle
they can be found in
QuickTime metadata atoms;

743
00:38:26.516 --> 00:38:29.666 A:middle
it could have been inserted
by iTunes; it could be found

744
00:38:29.666 --> 00:38:32.556 A:middle
in the MP4 metadata
box; or, finally,

745
00:38:32.586 --> 00:38:35.546 A:middle
metadata can be inserted
as ID3 frames directly

746
00:38:35.546 --> 00:38:36.386 A:middle
into your media stream.

747
00:38:38.686 --> 00:38:41.616 A:middle
So these values allow you to
interpret the value property,

748
00:38:41.616 --> 00:38:42.886 A:middle
which looks like this.

749
00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:46.306 A:middle
Each value has a key and,
between the key and the type,

750
00:38:47.366 --> 00:38:50.136 A:middle
you can uniquely identify
the meaning of the data value

751
00:38:50.136 --> 00:38:53.856 A:middle
or the data property, which can
be a string, an array, a number,

752
00:38:53.856 --> 00:38:55.746 A:middle
an array buffer,
any JavaScript type.

753
00:38:55.746 --> 00:38:59.376 A:middle
And the value may optionally
have a locale so you can choose

754
00:38:59.376 --> 00:39:03.716 A:middle
between a variety of available
cues for the current time based

755
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:05.456 A:middle
on the user's current
system locale.

756
00:39:06.346 --> 00:39:09.006 A:middle
So what would you use this for?

757
00:39:09.436 --> 00:39:13.046 A:middle
An extremely simple example
would be displaying the title

758
00:39:13.546 --> 00:39:15.876 A:middle
of a song in a long-playing
audio stream.

759
00:39:16.656 --> 00:39:20.086 A:middle
Another example would be to
add entry and exit points

760
00:39:20.306 --> 00:39:23.036 A:middle
to various places in your
media stream so you can track

761
00:39:23.036 --> 00:39:24.166 A:middle
where the users, say,

762
00:39:24.486 --> 00:39:27.126 A:middle
watch through an entire
ad or skipped over it.

763
00:39:28.506 --> 00:39:31.196 A:middle
But because you can package
any type of binary data you

764
00:39:31.196 --> 00:39:35.566 A:middle
like in an HLS stream or a
media file, the possibilities

765
00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:37.566 A:middle
for this API are
functionally endless.

766
00:39:38.996 --> 00:39:41.166 A:middle
And so Brent has an amazing
demo showing what kind

767
00:39:41.166 --> 00:39:43.066 A:middle
of awesome things you can
do with timed metadata.

768
00:39:43.716 --> 00:39:43.956 A:middle
Brent?

769
00:39:44.336 --> 00:39:44.826 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

770
00:39:47.576 --> 00:39:51.406 A:middle
So let's get back
to longboarding.

771
00:39:51.406 --> 00:39:58.996 A:middle
I have some more footage here
of a really nice day in Utah,

772
00:39:59.336 --> 00:40:04.126 A:middle
and we thought it would be
really neat to take advantage

773
00:40:04.126 --> 00:40:07.106 A:middle
of some of the metadata that
can be encoded in these videos.

774
00:40:07.566 --> 00:40:10.746 A:middle
Now our iDevices can already
collect a lot of things,

775
00:40:10.746 --> 00:40:15.566 A:middle
such as geolocation data
and, with newer devices,

776
00:40:15.566 --> 00:40:17.466 A:middle
we can now collect motion data.

777
00:40:17.466 --> 00:40:20.016 A:middle
There are a variety of
applications that you can use

778
00:40:20.016 --> 00:40:25.446 A:middle
that will encode other types
of data that are related

779
00:40:25.446 --> 00:40:28.806 A:middle
to other devices and things
that you may work with.

780
00:40:29.066 --> 00:40:31.006 A:middle
This can all be encoded together

781
00:40:31.006 --> 00:40:32.976 A:middle
and brought along as
part of the media.

782
00:40:32.976 --> 00:40:35.026 A:middle
And so I thought it'd
be really interesting

783
00:40:35.026 --> 00:40:36.806 A:middle
to see what we could
do with that.

784
00:40:36.986 --> 00:40:41.716 A:middle
Now, in this video, we had
some content that was embedded

785
00:40:42.686 --> 00:40:46.406 A:middle
in the media stream as ID3 tags,

786
00:40:46.406 --> 00:40:50.796 A:middle
so they contain a text
entry that's a JSON object

787
00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:52.656 A:middle
or an encoded JSON object.

788
00:40:52.896 --> 00:40:55.916 A:middle
And I wanted to get a feel
for what that looked like,

789
00:40:55.916 --> 00:41:00.986 A:middle
so I put together a page

790
00:41:00.986 --> 00:41:04.636 A:middle
that showed the same
longboarding video

791
00:41:06.026 --> 00:41:07.966 A:middle
with the metadata
displayed on the side.

792
00:41:08.056 --> 00:41:11.366 A:middle
And so you can see some
of the types of content

793
00:41:11.366 --> 00:41:12.116 A:middle
that would be in here.

794
00:41:12.116 --> 00:41:17.166 A:middle
Now this content was from a
specific use case, so it's going

795
00:41:17.166 --> 00:41:19.686 A:middle
to vary depending on where your
media comes from and what kinds

796
00:41:19.686 --> 00:41:21.486 A:middle
of tools are being used
to put it together.

797
00:41:21.486 --> 00:41:25.306 A:middle
But, in this case, we have a
speed; we have an ordered list

798
00:41:25.306 --> 00:41:27.836 A:middle
of skaters; we've
got a notes field.

799
00:41:27.836 --> 00:41:28.896 A:middle
So I thought it'd be interesting

800
00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:30.836 A:middle
to see what we could
do with that.

801
00:41:30.836 --> 00:41:35.266 A:middle
Now let me just briefly
show you what I did

802
00:41:35.266 --> 00:41:39.526 A:middle
to get this data to display.

803
00:41:42.106 --> 00:41:47.726 A:middle
Okay, so just like before,
we have a video source

804
00:41:48.096 --> 00:41:54.136 A:middle
that in this case is
another .m3u8 encoded video.

805
00:41:54.376 --> 00:41:58.746 A:middle
When the video starts, I've
added an onloadstart handler

806
00:41:58.746 --> 00:42:02.346 A:middle
so that, when the stream starts
playing, we can do something.

807
00:42:02.826 --> 00:42:09.226 A:middle
And what we do is, we need
to register an event listener

808
00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:11.466 A:middle
for the add track event
so that we can know

809
00:42:11.676 --> 00:42:13.416 A:middle
when tracks are being
added to the streams.

810
00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:15.586 A:middle
So the metadata-the
video will start playing

811
00:42:15.586 --> 00:42:19.446 A:middle
and then the metadata will
be recognized by the system,

812
00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:21.226 A:middle
and it'll fire this event.

813
00:42:22.376 --> 00:42:24.116 A:middle
When the track has been added,

814
00:42:25.596 --> 00:42:28.026 A:middle
I want to add another event
listener for 'cuechange'.

815
00:42:28.026 --> 00:42:32.036 A:middle
This is the part where WebKit
will be firing these cue change

816
00:42:32.036 --> 00:42:35.076 A:middle
events as this metadata is
encountered in the playback.

817
00:42:36.426 --> 00:42:40.676 A:middle
Very important is this, where
we set the mode to 'hidden'.

818
00:42:41.236 --> 00:42:46.756 A:middle
Now the tracks in the system
come through in a default state

819
00:42:46.756 --> 00:42:50.236 A:middle
of disabled, which means
that you will not get events.

820
00:42:51.866 --> 00:42:54.006 A:middle
We set it to 'hidden'
because we don't really want

821
00:42:54.006 --> 00:42:56.216 A:middle
to see this content,
and we don't want WebKit

822
00:42:56.216 --> 00:42:59.056 A:middle
to necessarily do anything
with it, but we do want

823
00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:02.216 A:middle
to receive events when
these cues are encountered

824
00:43:02.216 --> 00:43:03.406 A:middle
so that we can do
something with that.

825
00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:06.086 A:middle
And so, finally,
the meat of this is

826
00:43:06.086 --> 00:43:11.126 A:middle
in the 'cuechange' event
handler where, because I know

827
00:43:11.126 --> 00:43:15.166 A:middle
that this data is JSON, I was
able to just take the data cue,

828
00:43:15.256 --> 00:43:19.416 A:middle
which is a WebKit
data track object

829
00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:22.386 A:middle
that like Jer just
told us about,

830
00:43:22.386 --> 00:43:25.076 A:middle
and retrieve the
data portion of that

831
00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:26.976 A:middle
and parse it as a JSON object.

832
00:43:28.076 --> 00:43:31.046 A:middle
Once I did that, obviously, the
first thing I did was to take

833
00:43:31.046 --> 00:43:37.466 A:middle
that reconstituted JSON object
and immediately re-stringify it.

834
00:43:37.506 --> 00:43:40.206 A:middle
Why? Because I just wanted to
pre-print it for the screen

835
00:43:40.206 --> 00:43:41.916 A:middle
and I didn't want to have to
like write anything to do that.

836
00:43:41.916 --> 00:43:45.016 A:middle
So JSON.stringify will do
that for you and then you end

837
00:43:45.016 --> 00:43:49.166 A:middle
up with something that looks
a little bit like this.

838
00:43:49.676 --> 00:43:52.426 A:middle
And that's great, we're getting
metadata that's firing a few

839
00:43:52.426 --> 00:43:55.336 A:middle
times a second and we have this
information we can do something

840
00:43:55.336 --> 00:43:58.836 A:middle
with, but it's not really
that compelling an example.

841
00:43:58.836 --> 00:43:59.996 A:middle
It wasn't that interesting,
so I thought,

842
00:43:59.996 --> 00:44:01.546 A:middle
"What else could we do this?"

843
00:44:01.546 --> 00:44:02.666 A:middle
Well, we have a speed.

844
00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:07.816 A:middle
What if we modified it so
that I could show a HUD

845
00:44:07.906 --> 00:44:09.096 A:middle
with a speed indicator on it?

846
00:44:09.096 --> 00:44:10.536 A:middle
That would be kind of
cool, we could kind

847
00:44:10.536 --> 00:44:15.176 A:middle
of see how fast people were
going, so to do that we need

848
00:44:15.176 --> 00:44:16.366 A:middle
to make a few changes.

849
00:44:16.816 --> 00:44:18.666 A:middle
First, I'm going to
go ahead and get rid

850
00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:21.486 A:middle
of this brief little style
sheet I put in here just to kind

851
00:44:21.486 --> 00:44:23.986 A:middle
of get things on the
screen, and replace it

852
00:44:23.986 --> 00:44:27.536 A:middle
with a more full-featured
style sheet.

853
00:44:28.646 --> 00:44:31.786 A:middle
And I'm going to modify
the 'cuechange' event.

854
00:44:32.096 --> 00:44:36.526 A:middle
I don't need to re-stringify the
JSON object now that I have it.

855
00:44:37.606 --> 00:44:40.466 A:middle
All I need to do is grab the
speed out of the JSON payload

856
00:44:40.466 --> 00:44:47.336 A:middle
and stick it in a &lt;div&gt;
that I just named "speed",

857
00:44:47.336 --> 00:44:53.246 A:middle
and then I'm going to
go ahead and add a &lt;div&gt;

858
00:44:53.926 --> 00:44:57.806 A:middle
to hold the HUD for that.

859
00:44:59.876 --> 00:45:05.196 A:middle
We'll call this "AWEsome-er".

860
00:45:05.196 --> 00:45:07.646 A:middle
All right, so what
would this look like?

861
00:45:07.646 --> 00:45:11.016 A:middle
So now we have our little
HUD on the top of the screen.

862
00:45:11.076 --> 00:45:13.656 A:middle
And, if I begin video playback,

863
00:45:13.656 --> 00:45:17.716 A:middle
now we have a little
speedometer running.

864
00:45:17.716 --> 00:45:21.886 A:middle
So now we have live overlay
in this video playback.

865
00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:27.866 A:middle
We've got content that's being
written by us and added by us,

866
00:45:27.866 --> 00:45:33.026 A:middle
live on the web page, and
this is kind of an example

867
00:45:33.026 --> 00:45:35.396 A:middle
of what you can do with
this kind of information.

868
00:45:35.756 --> 00:45:37.046 A:middle
Well, I thought this
was kind of fun,

869
00:45:37.046 --> 00:45:38.776 A:middle
but we could probably do more.

870
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:41.856 A:middle
There was other content
there; there was a notes field

871
00:45:41.856 --> 00:45:44.456 A:middle
that had information
that called out things

872
00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:48.876 A:middle
that they might be doing on
screen; and we had information

873
00:45:48.876 --> 00:45:50.656 A:middle
about the ordered
list of the skaters.

874
00:45:50.656 --> 00:45:55.836 A:middle
So I thought, "Well, why
don't we make a leaderboard

875
00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:58.466 A:middle
that showed kind of who is in
what position and maybe call

876
00:45:58.466 --> 00:46:00.676 A:middle
out any tracks or other
information like that."

877
00:46:00.676 --> 00:46:03.416 A:middle
So what we need to
do is, in addition,

878
00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:04.716 A:middle
in my 'cuechange' event handler,

879
00:46:04.716 --> 00:46:06.316 A:middle
in addition to the
speed indicator,

880
00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:11.026 A:middle
I want to have a method that
will show the skaters in order

881
00:46:11.026 --> 00:46:13.806 A:middle
and I want to have a method
that will display the tricks

882
00:46:13.806 --> 00:46:14.846 A:middle
that are being done on screen.

883
00:46:15.086 --> 00:46:18.766 A:middle
I'm not going to
go into much detail

884
00:46:19.066 --> 00:46:24.846 A:middle
about how this works except to
say that, to show the skaters

885
00:46:24.846 --> 00:46:28.206 A:middle
in order, I basically have
a first, second, third,

886
00:46:28.206 --> 00:46:32.226 A:middle
fourth CSS class that I
set up in the style sheet.

887
00:46:32.446 --> 00:46:34.916 A:middle
And I just iterate through that
list of ordered skaters and,

888
00:46:34.916 --> 00:46:37.456 A:middle
as the skater names come
in, I styled the &lt;div&gt;

889
00:46:37.456 --> 00:46:39.756 A:middle
that has the name of that
skater in first, second,

890
00:46:39.756 --> 00:46:40.796 A:middle
third or fourth position.

891
00:46:40.956 --> 00:46:46.226 A:middle
Likewise, I'm going to have
some code to show the tricks

892
00:46:46.226 --> 00:46:49.516 A:middle
as they come in, and here
I'm just going to add a &lt;div&gt;

893
00:46:49.516 --> 00:46:52.556 A:middle
to the page that is styled
with the "trick" style.

894
00:46:53.136 --> 00:47:00.236 A:middle
With a little bit of CSS
animation, we should be done.

895
00:47:01.006 --> 00:47:03.596 A:middle
Then let me go ahead
and add some &lt;div&gt;'s

896
00:47:03.596 --> 00:47:04.876 A:middle
to hold all the skaters.

897
00:47:04.876 --> 00:47:07.356 A:middle
I've given the &lt;div&gt;'s
the names of the skaters

898
00:47:07.356 --> 00:47:10.066 A:middle
and that makes it easy
for setting this all up.

899
00:47:10.966 --> 00:47:12.336 A:middle
Now let's take a look
at what that looks like.

900
00:47:13.046 --> 00:47:16.026 A:middle
So now I've got a HUD, I've
got the skaters in the top,

901
00:47:16.026 --> 00:47:18.156 A:middle
I've freeze framed a few things

902
00:47:18.156 --> 00:47:20.056 A:middle
and grabbed some
snapshots to show them off.

903
00:47:20.616 --> 00:47:23.706 A:middle
Let's go ahead and
get it started.

904
00:47:24.666 --> 00:47:28.346 A:middle
There we go and so now we're
getting live playback on top

905
00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:29.946 A:middle
of the video with the skaters.

906
00:47:30.656 --> 00:47:33.656 A:middle
And let me just point out that
these guys look really good,

907
00:47:33.656 --> 00:47:35.436 A:middle
but imagine the skill it takes

908
00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:38.636 A:middle
to be skating backwards filming
this, and I think you'll agree

909
00:47:38.636 --> 00:47:41.536 A:middle
that a lot of the magic
is happening offscreen.

910
00:47:42.416 --> 00:47:46.966 A:middle
So here, timed metadata
events are firing,

911
00:47:47.176 --> 00:47:51.236 A:middle
we're seeing speed changes,
we're seeing tricks being called

912
00:47:51.236 --> 00:47:52.726 A:middle
out as they're moving along,

913
00:47:52.726 --> 00:47:55.186 A:middle
and this is all happening
live-I'm not baking this

914
00:47:55.186 --> 00:47:56.066 A:middle
into the video.

915
00:47:56.066 --> 00:47:58.436 A:middle
I could have done that, but
then we wouldn't be able

916
00:47:58.436 --> 00:48:00.816 A:middle
to modify this, change
colors and whatever else.

917
00:48:01.546 --> 00:48:03.506 A:middle
And this is the good part here.

918
00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:08.326 A:middle
This guy, Alan, he saw
something, he just slid away.

919
00:48:08.326 --> 00:48:11.336 A:middle
Here we are, he's going
to notice something.

920
00:48:11.336 --> 00:48:12.286 A:middle
Danger is spotted.

921
00:48:12.286 --> 00:48:13.466 A:middle
He's going to bail out.

922
00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:17.316 A:middle
Poor Fred, ah, he hit the
pothole, had to get off.

923
00:48:17.316 --> 00:48:18.626 A:middle
He's now out of the race.

924
00:48:18.626 --> 00:48:20.806 A:middle
He's got an X and he falls away.

925
00:48:21.426 --> 00:48:23.966 A:middle
And our last skater ends,

926
00:48:23.966 --> 00:48:25.686 A:middle
and we get the positions
of the skaters.

927
00:48:27.006 --> 00:48:30.446 A:middle
And so that's just a brief
example of what you can do

928
00:48:30.446 --> 00:48:35.316 A:middle
with these kinds of metadata
events and a little bit of CSS

929
00:48:35.316 --> 00:48:37.966 A:middle
and JavaScript on top
of the live video.

930
00:48:38.316 --> 00:48:41.736 A:middle
I hope you guys understand
why we think this is

931
00:48:41.736 --> 00:48:45.536 A:middle
such an exciting technology,
and I can't wait to see what all

932
00:48:45.536 --> 00:48:47.016 A:middle
of you will do with
this in the future.

933
00:48:47.406 --> 00:48:49.166 A:middle
Thank you very much
and, back to you, Jer.

934
00:48:49.716 --> 00:48:50.166 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Brent.

935
00:48:50.166 --> 00:48:53.136 A:middle
That was some amazing
backwards cinematography there.

936
00:48:53.756 --> 00:48:55.536 A:middle
So let's sum up what you
guys have heard today.

937
00:48:56.206 --> 00:49:03.316 A:middle
Video in Safari on iOS and OS
X are now closer in behavior

938
00:49:03.516 --> 00:49:06.286 A:middle
by supporting the
preload attribute on iOS

939
00:49:06.286 --> 00:49:07.996 A:middle
and allowing the &lt;video&gt; element

940
00:49:07.996 --> 00:49:10.216 A:middle
to fully participate
in CSS layering.

941
00:49:10.866 --> 00:49:12.536 A:middle
You've also seen how to use HLS

942
00:49:12.536 --> 00:49:14.826 A:middle
to add adaptive streaming
support to your pages,

943
00:49:15.716 --> 00:49:16.836 A:middle
and you've learned how

944
00:49:16.836 --> 00:49:19.266 A:middle
to improve your user's
power efficiency

945
00:49:19.476 --> 00:49:21.306 A:middle
by playing back video
in your pages.

946
00:49:21.846 --> 00:49:24.126 A:middle
And you've also seen how
to use timed metadata

947
00:49:24.126 --> 00:49:27.006 A:middle
to coordinate events in your
page with your media's timeline.

948
00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:32.226 A:middle
So, for more information, please

Developers documentation

00:49:35.516 --> 00:49:37.006 A:middle
