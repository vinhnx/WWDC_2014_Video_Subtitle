&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Vice President,

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:28.756 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:31.976 A:middle
Welcome to the 25th WWDC.

[ Cheering ]

7
00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:41.076 A:middle
So, if you watched the
keynote this morning,

8
00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:44.006 A:middle
you will have noticed that this
year we have a very strong focus

9
00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:45.546 A:middle
on our developer technologies.

10
00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:49.336 A:middle
We're building out our
entire platform ecosystem,

11
00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.166 A:middle
and 2014 is going to see some

12
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.446 A:middle
of the largest developed
releases in years.

13
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.006 A:middle
We are adding an incredible
number of new APIs.

14
00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:01.316 A:middle
We're giving you access to
more low-level technologies,

15
00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:04.906 A:middle
and as always, we're moving
all parts of the ecosystem,

16
00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:08.336 A:middle
hardware, software, services,

17
00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:11.396 A:middle
and developer tools
forward together,

18
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.036 A:middle
which is something
only Apple can do.

19
00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.966 A:middle
Our focus on developers
is paying off very nicely.

20
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.696 A:middle
As we saw from some
of the numbers shown

21
00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:22.096 A:middle
in the keynote this
morning, there are now more

22
00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:24.606 A:middle
than 1.2 million apps
in the App Store.

23
00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:28.006 A:middle
They have been downloaded
over 75 billion times.

24
00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.956 A:middle
And this huge success story is,
of course, only made possible

25
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.566 A:middle
by you, the app developers.

26
00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:37.916 A:middle
And you're part of a very,
very active community.

27
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.786 A:middle
Since we shipped the last update

28
00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:42.326 A:middle
of our Xcode IDE just
a few months ago,

29
00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:45.786 A:middle
it has been downloaded
more than 14 million times,

30
00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:49.526 A:middle
and we are adding developers to
our community at an amazing rate

31
00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:53.856 A:middle
of more than 120,000 brand-new
developers downloading Xcode

32
00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:54.916 A:middle
every single month.

33
00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:57.986 A:middle
So, let's take a look
at what we're doing

34
00:01:57.986 --> 00:02:01.416 A:middle
with our iOS App Store to make
you guys even more successful.

35
00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:05.306 A:middle
This year, we're improving
how users can discover apps

36
00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:10.356 A:middle
by adding things like related
searches, trending searches,

37
00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:12.486 A:middle
and editor's choice badges,

38
00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:15.226 A:middle
which will help promote the most
noteworthy apps in the store.

39
00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:21.056 A:middle
It will also allow you to
advertise your apps better

40
00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:23.836 A:middle
by including preview
movies, which will play

41
00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:25.476 A:middle
for the users browsing
the store.

42
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.886 A:middle
And if you're a developer
of multiple apps,

43
00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:30.726 A:middle
you can even bundle them
all together and sell them

44
00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.406 A:middle
at a discounted price,
if you would like.

45
00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:35.246 A:middle
Now, we're not stopping

46
00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:37.276 A:middle
at making the App Store
experience itself better.

47
00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:38.766 A:middle
We're also working very,

48
00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:41.376 A:middle
very hard on improving
the developer experience.

49
00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:43.556 A:middle
So later this year, we're going

50
00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:46.286 A:middle
to give iTunes Connect,
a new, cleaner look.

51
00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:48.426 A:middle
It will have a new-

[ Applause ]

53
00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:56.786 A:middle
It will have a new dashboard
that will show information

54
00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:58.856 A:middle
about your apps, and
most importantly,

55
00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:01.236 A:middle
we are adding variable
analytics.

56
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:07.746 A:middle
[ Applause ]

57
00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:11.746 A:middle
These analytics will tell you
how many users visited your app,

58
00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:15.476 A:middle
your store pages, how many users
went on and purchased your app.

[ Applause ]

60
00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:23.626 A:middle
How many remained
active over time.

61
00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.896 A:middle
And best of all, collecting all
this information is fed right

62
00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.196 A:middle
into iOS and it's
completely automatic.

63
00:03:30.316 --> 00:03:32.686 A:middle
There's no need for any kind
of special libraries or code

64
00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:34.706 A:middle
on your part to turn
on analytics.

[ Applause ]

66
00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:42.926 A:middle
Now, many developers
have also asked for a way

67
00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:45.786 A:middle
to distribute beta versions of
their apps before they ship,

68
00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:48.416 A:middle
and we are pleased to announce
our new TestFlight service,

69
00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:51.306 A:middle
which will allow you
to do exactly that.

70
00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:56.016 A:middle
Users become beta testers by
downloading the TestFlight app.

[ Applause ]

72
00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:05.926 A:middle
The app will give them
access to the beta versions

73
00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:07.856 A:middle
that are not available in
the full App Store yet,

74
00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:10.906 A:middle
and they download
these apps simply,

75
00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:13.366 A:middle
and they download these apps
simply with their Apple ID.

76
00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.676 A:middle
There's no need for any
kind of special profiles.

77

[ Applause ]

78
00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:27.496 A:middle
Each app can have to, can
have up to 1000 beta testers,

79
00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:31.496 A:middle
and notice that this is a limit
of 1000 users, not 1000 devices.

80
00:04:31.496 --> 00:04:31.576 A:middle
So-

81
00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:39.676 A:middle
[ Applause ]

82
00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:41.936 A:middle
So, all these users
can run your apps,

83
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:44.616 A:middle
your apps on multiple
devices at the same time.

84
00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:47.936 A:middle
And we will even allow you
to use the TestFlight service

85
00:04:47.936 --> 00:04:50.786 A:middle
to distribute apps within
your own development team,

86
00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:53.036 A:middle
in that case without
app review, and again,

87
00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:54.566 A:middle
without any kind of
special profiles.

[ Applause ]

89
00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:03.386 A:middle
Also, later this year, we
we'll ship the final version

90
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.266 A:middle
of Xcode 6.

91
00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.836 A:middle
We will allow you to
include your app's symbols

92
00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:12.136 A:middle
with your App Store submissions
because later next year,

93
00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:14.656 A:middle
we will start servicing
fully aggregated

94
00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:16.816 A:middle
and symbolicated crash
reports for your apps.

[ Applause ]

96
00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:26.106 A:middle
And you'll be able to work

97
00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:28.676 A:middle
through these crash reports
within the Xcode IDE.

98
00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:32.326 A:middle
So, we have a huge update
for the App Store this year.

99
00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:33.816 A:middle
There are several
end-user features

100
00:05:33.856 --> 00:05:35.706 A:middle
that will help discoverability
of apps

101
00:05:36.196 --> 00:05:39.836 A:middle
and a completely revamped
iTunes Connect with analytics,

102
00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:42.346 A:middle
TestFlight, and later, also
better crash reporting.

103
00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:46.476 A:middle
Now, let's move on
to the surprise news

104
00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:48.876 A:middle
of this year's developer
conference-Swift.

105
00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:53.126 A:middle
Swift is the brand-new
developer,

106
00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:57.056 A:middle
brand-new program language
designed by Apple specifically

107
00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.586 A:middle
for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

108
00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:03.036 A:middle
It works beautifully with our
system APIs, and it's designed

109
00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:04.516 A:middle
with the common programming
patterns

110
00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:05.876 A:middle
on our platforms in mind.

111
00:06:07.426 --> 00:06:09.166 A:middle
Now, there are a lot of
program languages out there.

112
00:06:10.196 --> 00:06:13.466 A:middle
On the iOS and OS X, most of you
use an object-oriented variant

113
00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:16.026 A:middle
of C, C++, or Objective-C,

114
00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:18.466 A:middle
which so far has been our system
program language of choice.

115
00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:21.926 A:middle
The problem we were facing
was that pretty much all

116
00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:24.936 A:middle
of these languages either fit in
the category of high performance

117
00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:27.466 A:middle
but low productivity
or in the category

118
00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:29.526 A:middle
of high productivity
but low performance.

119
00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:32.036 A:middle
But we want developers
on our platforms

120
00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:35.016 A:middle
to have a language available to
them that gives them the best

121
00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:37.406 A:middle
of both worlds, and that's
why we created Swift.

122
00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.436 A:middle
Swift is very modern.

123
00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:42.266 A:middle
It has all the things
you would expect

124
00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:43.536 A:middle
from a new program language.

125
00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:45.646 A:middle
It has a nicely tuned syntax.

126
00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:48.846 A:middle
It allows you to write very
compact, very expressive code

127
00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:51.326 A:middle
with features like
clojures and generics.

128
00:06:53.186 --> 00:06:55.516 A:middle
Here are a few examples
of Swift code next

129
00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:57.506 A:middle
to some typically Objective-C
code you might write.

130
00:06:58.286 --> 00:07:00.446 A:middle
You can really see that
Swift is a lot more compact.

131
00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:04.306 A:middle
It even has dedicated syntax
for a common operation

132
00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:05.546 A:middle
like a respondsToSelector test.

133
00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:10.156 A:middle
And here you can also see that
we are using common dot syntax

134
00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:11.996 A:middle
for function and
selector implications.

135
00:07:14.556 --> 00:07:16.636 A:middle
Swift is also designed
to be safe.

136
00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:21.316 A:middle
It will prevent you from
introducing typical bugs

137
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:25.706 A:middle
or stability issues simply
by enforcing best practices

138
00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:28.796 A:middle
for writing code, so that for
example you don't end up working

139
00:07:28.796 --> 00:07:30.836 A:middle
with an uninitialized
variable or running

140
00:07:30.836 --> 00:07:32.306 A:middle
out of bounds with
an array index.

141
00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:35.496 A:middle
And Swift is fast.

142
00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:38.096 A:middle
We've really tuned the compiler

143
00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:39.806 A:middle
and the language
runtime together

144
00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:43.276 A:middle
to optimize the most common
operations on our platform.

145
00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:45.976 A:middle
Here's an example benchmark.

146
00:07:46.046 --> 00:07:47.456 A:middle
This is a Complex Object Sort.

147
00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:51.116 A:middle
You can really see how Swift
outperforms Objective-C and,

148
00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.306 A:middle
certainly, scripting languages.

149
00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:56.156 A:middle
Now, the best way to tell you a
little bit more about Swift is

150
00:07:56.156 --> 00:07:57.196 A:middle
to simply write some code.

151
00:07:57.636 --> 00:07:59.836 A:middle
So, I'm going to ask Ted
Kremenek to come up on stage

152
00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:01.866 A:middle
and give you a demo
of the basics

153
00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:03.666 A:middle
of the Swift programming
language.

155

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Andreas.

156
00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:15.146 A:middle
So, I'm going to take
you on a quick tour

157
00:08:15.346 --> 00:08:16.406 A:middle
of the Swift language,

158
00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:19.026 A:middle
and doesn't the terminal
look beautiful in Yosemite?

159
00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:22.646 A:middle
We're going to fire
up the compiler

160
00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:24.596 A:middle
in an interactive
coding mode called a

161
00:08:24.636 --> 00:08:27.116 A:middle
Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop,
or REPL.

00:08:27.116 --> 00:08:29.456 A:middle
I just type code
in, it gets compiled

163
00:08:29.456 --> 00:08:31.066 A:middle
on the fly, and executes.

164
00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:34.506 A:middle
We'll start it off with
a simple, "hello world."

165
00:08:35.426 --> 00:08:38.135 A:middle
This one line of code
is all you would need

166
00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:41.186 A:middle
to write your first
working Swift program.

167
00:08:41.885 --> 00:08:44.086 A:middle
Whereas we would naturally
want to move on now

168
00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:46.416 A:middle
to doing more interesting
things like declaring variables.

169
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:51.896 A:middle
Now, you notice, I'm not
actually writing the types

170
00:08:52.016 --> 00:08:52.756 A:middle
for these variables.

171
00:08:53.396 --> 00:08:56.066 A:middle
That's because the Swift
compiler has powerful type

172
00:08:56.246 --> 00:08:59.716 A:middle
inference that infers that
X has the, has the type int

173
00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:02.696 A:middle
because I initialized
it with the value 42.

174
00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:05.886 A:middle
Similarly, for S we infer
that it has a type string

175
00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:07.786 A:middle
because I initialized it
with a string constant,

176
00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:10.996 A:middle
and this means it makes the
code feel very lightweight.

177
00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:13.216 A:middle
Now, I have a lot to show you,

178
00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:14.986 A:middle
so instead of me
typing everything,

179
00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:16.316 A:middle
I'm going to have
some assistance here

180
00:09:16.316 --> 00:09:18.266 A:middle
with the keystrokes but
everything is still going

181
00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:19.706 A:middle
to be live in the REPL.

182
00:09:21.056 --> 00:09:23.606 A:middle
Let's move on to simple
containers, like arrays.

183
00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:26.976 A:middle
Now, you can see the syntax
is very light and natural.

184
00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:28.446 A:middle
Here I have an array
of integers,

185
00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:30.796 A:middle
similarly, an array of strings.

186
00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:34.946 A:middle
Again, I didn't write the types
because type inference came in

187
00:09:34.946 --> 00:09:39.106 A:middle
and it inferred the types of
the arrays just by the contents

188
00:09:39.186 --> 00:09:41.806 A:middle
of the array that I used
to initialize the array.

189
00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:46.006 A:middle
Now, arrays behave pretty much
as you would expect, you know,

190
00:09:46.006 --> 00:09:49.046 A:middle
I have subscripting, which
can be used in, you know,

191
00:09:49.386 --> 00:09:50.836 A:middle
subexpressions and so on.

192
00:09:51.806 --> 00:09:53.576 A:middle
But an important thing

193
00:09:53.846 --> 00:09:58.356 A:middle
about arrays is all their
accesses are balance checked.

194
00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:02.406 A:middle
This is part of Swift's
safe by default design.

195
00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:04.636 A:middle
In a normal-running program,

196
00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:07.006 A:middle
execution would stop
at this point.

197
00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:09.286 A:middle
Since we're in the REPL,
we can keep on going,

198
00:10:09.286 --> 00:10:12.246 A:middle
but this is really kind of a
fundamental keystone of the,

199
00:10:12.246 --> 00:10:13.316 A:middle
of the Swift language.

200
00:10:15.226 --> 00:10:18.706 A:middle
Now, arrays are just like
any other type in Swift.

201
00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:20.026 A:middle
They have certain capabilities,

202
00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:22.876 A:middle
like computer properties that's
going to tell me the size

203
00:10:22.876 --> 00:10:26.986 A:middle
of the array, or methods
to remove and add elements.

204
00:10:28.536 --> 00:10:30.476 A:middle
And because arrays
are containers,

205
00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:33.696 A:middle
they can also be used
with this very generalized

206
00:10:33.696 --> 00:10:34.636 A:middle
for...in syntax.

207
00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:38.776 A:middle
It works for collections,
ranges of numbers, sequences,

208
00:10:39.286 --> 00:10:41.806 A:middle
and here I'm looping over
the values of the array

209
00:10:42.136 --> 00:10:42.966 A:middle
and printing them out.

210
00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:46.586 A:middle
And you'll notice I'm using
a very lightweight string

211
00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:48.606 A:middle
formatting called
string interpolation.

212
00:10:49.176 --> 00:10:52.246 A:middle
Essentially, I have a string
constant that I can just splat

213
00:10:52.246 --> 00:10:54.536 A:middle
in an expression that gets
converted into a string

214
00:10:54.766 --> 00:10:56.956 A:middle
and spliced into the rest
of the printed out string.

215
00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:59.846 A:middle
It's very really nice for doing
lightweight string formatting.

216
00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:04.246 A:middle
Swift also has
batteries-included support

217
00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:07.376 A:middle
for dictionaries, and these
are also strungly typed.

218
00:11:08.116 --> 00:11:10.826 A:middle
Here, type for instance inferred
that I have a dictionary

219
00:11:10.876 --> 00:11:12.976 A:middle
that maps from strings
to doubles.

220
00:11:14.776 --> 00:11:17.576 A:middle
I can also use the for...in
syntax with them as well,

221
00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:21.676 A:middle
but in this case, I get a
key value pair all in one go,

222
00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:23.456 A:middle
if I wanted to print
it out all the values.

223
00:11:26.156 --> 00:11:27.046 A:middle
Let's move on to functions.

224
00:11:27.766 --> 00:11:29.786 A:middle
And you still see the
syntax looks very similar

225
00:11:29.786 --> 00:11:30.746 A:middle
to variable declarations

226
00:11:30.746 --> 00:11:32.756 A:middle
and you'll see there's
this reoccurring theme

227
00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:35.636 A:middle
in the language with the, where
the syntax is, it's simple.

228
00:11:35.636 --> 00:11:36.846 A:middle
It's composable.

229
00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:37.596 A:middle
It's very regular.

230
00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:38.596 A:middle
It's very easy to read.

231
00:11:39.446 --> 00:11:40.716 A:middle
So, we start out
with the fun keyword,

232
00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.906 A:middle
the name of the function,
its arguments,

233
00:11:43.186 --> 00:11:44.946 A:middle
in this case we're taking
an array of integers,

234
00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:47.266 A:middle
and then the return
value is at the end.

235
00:11:47.266 --> 00:11:49.946 A:middle
In this case, we're
returning an int.

236
00:11:50.886 --> 00:11:52.986 A:middle
This simple function
just loops and, you know,

237
00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:55.006 A:middle
it loops over the
array and sums up,

238
00:11:55.806 --> 00:11:57.626 A:middle
sums up the numbers
and returns them.

239
00:11:59.046 --> 00:12:01.236 A:middle
Call syntax looks just
as you would expect.

240
00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:03.556 A:middle
This is a very simple example.

241
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.686 A:middle
Let's say we wanted to
extend it, all right?

242
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:06.906 A:middle
So, I'm, I'm doing
all this work,

243
00:12:06.906 --> 00:12:08.126 A:middle
I'm looping over the array.

244
00:12:08.576 --> 00:12:11.476 A:middle
Let's say I wanted to return
the average at the same time

245
00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:12.486 A:middle
as I'm computing the sum.

246
00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:15.396 A:middle
We can do that in
Swift via support

247
00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:19.816 A:middle
for multiple return values,
and all I have to do-

248
00:12:20.516 --> 00:12:24.536 A:middle
[ Applause ]

249
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.356 A:middle
-is change the return
value to a tuple.

250
00:12:28.286 --> 00:12:30.686 A:middle
The rest of the function
looks pretty much as before,

251
00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:33.986 A:middle
except you see at the return
site we return a pair.

252
00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:38.246 A:middle
And so when we call this
function, we get a tuple back.

253
00:12:39.086 --> 00:12:41.856 A:middle
And if you notice at the
top, I put these labels,

254
00:12:42.246 --> 00:12:44.896 A:middle
sum and average, on
the tuple pieces.

255
00:12:45.826 --> 00:12:48.876 A:middle
It means I can access the
pieces of the tuple by name

256
00:12:49.876 --> 00:12:52.476 A:middle
and because the language has
powerful pattern matching,

257
00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:55.566 A:middle
I could just declare two new
variables, sum and average,

258
00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:58.946 A:middle
to decompose the value of the
return value all in one go.

259
00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:06.886 A:middle
[ Applause ]

260
00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:10.576 A:middle
And of course, the language has
been crafted to work beautifully

261
00:13:10.906 --> 00:13:12.546 A:middle
with Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

262
00:13:12.996 --> 00:13:15.886 A:middle
With this one line of code,
I can import in all the APIs

263
00:13:15.886 --> 00:13:18.376 A:middle
from the Cocoa framework
on OS X.

264
00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:20.666 A:middle
And I can immediately
start playing with it.

265
00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:22.666 A:middle
So, for example, I saw

266
00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:24.336 A:middle
in Yosemite we have
this new look and feel.

267
00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:26.846 A:middle
Let's take a peek at the
new default system font.

268
00:13:28.526 --> 00:13:31.756 A:middle
Here's what's going on here, is
I am accessing a class method

269
00:13:32.086 --> 00:13:35.266 A:middle
on NSFont that returns
me an object

270
00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:36.496 A:middle
for the default system font.

271
00:13:37.456 --> 00:13:40.276 A:middle
And so this is a real
object from Objective-C.

272
00:13:41.476 --> 00:13:44.046 A:middle
I can access properties
on it, call methods,

273
00:13:44.476 --> 00:13:45.676 A:middle
do everything that you expect.

274
00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:49.466 A:middle
Now, another important piece
of Cocoa are protocols,

275
00:13:49.536 --> 00:13:51.786 A:middle
and Swift supports
protocols beautifully.

276
00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:55.136 A:middle
Syntax is also very
regular and simple.

277
00:13:56.346 --> 00:13:59.036 A:middle
Here, for example, I'm
declaring a protocol scalable

278
00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:02.636 A:middle
that models the idea that a
graphical entity is scalable.

279
00:14:02.746 --> 00:14:04.566 A:middle
I should be able to, you
know, scale it up in size,

280
00:14:04.566 --> 00:14:07.496 A:middle
scale it down, and I can,
it defines a single method

281
00:14:07.706 --> 00:14:10.016 A:middle
that returns a new
value that's scaled.

282
00:14:11.236 --> 00:14:15.066 A:middle
And just like Objective-C, I can
retroactively add conformants

283
00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:19.876 A:middle
to a protocol, to a class, using
something called an extension.

284
00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:22.516 A:middle
They're similar to
categories in Objective-C

285
00:14:22.886 --> 00:14:23.866 A:middle
but a bit more powerful.

286
00:14:25.506 --> 00:14:27.936 A:middle
And you see, I've just
defined the method right there,

287
00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:29.896 A:middle
and now I can call it.

288
00:14:32.476 --> 00:14:36.526 A:middle
And so I've returned a font
that's twice the point size

289
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.906 A:middle
as the original, all on
the fly, here in the REPL.

290
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:44.926 A:middle
Now, also in Cocoa, we
haves structs, right?

291
00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.386 A:middle
Structs are simple data
types for aggregating data,

292
00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:49.926 A:middle
but despite being simple,

293
00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:51.876 A:middle
they're really powerful
in Swift.

294
00:14:52.756 --> 00:14:55.096 A:middle
Let's take a look at
our old friend, CGRect.

295
00:14:56.046 --> 00:14:58.166 A:middle
Now, many of you who have used
this API are probably used

296
00:14:58.166 --> 00:15:01.156 A:middle
to creating instances of
CGRect using CGRectMake.

297
00:15:02.346 --> 00:15:05.916 A:middle
Well, in Swift, you can also
use just a uniform construction

298
00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:08.646 A:middle
syntax to construct
values in struct as well.

299
00:15:09.056 --> 00:15:12.326 A:middle
And here we see the actual
labels being put on the,

300
00:15:12.326 --> 00:15:14.136 A:middle
on the values that
we're initializing.

301
00:15:16.136 --> 00:15:21.636 A:middle
Now, looking at CGRect, wouldn't
it be great if it had a property

302
00:15:21.636 --> 00:15:24.126 A:middle
on an area that could tell
me the area of a rectangle?

303
00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:26.996 A:middle
You can't define
this in Objective-C.

304
00:15:26.996 --> 00:15:29.036 A:middle
Objective-C does not have
properties on structs.

305
00:15:29.906 --> 00:15:30.806 A:middle
But Swift does.

306
00:15:33.256 --> 00:15:36.996 A:middle
I can retroactively now
add this computer property

307
00:15:37.216 --> 00:15:39.676 A:middle
to the struct using
it in an extension.

308
00:15:40.296 --> 00:15:41.736 A:middle
This is what a computer
property look like.

309
00:15:41.736 --> 00:15:44.106 A:middle
It just looks like a variable
declaration with a bit

310
00:15:44.106 --> 00:15:47.116 A:middle
of code added on, on the side
for the value being computed.

311
00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:50.826 A:middle
And I just defined
it, and indeed,

312
00:15:50.996 --> 00:15:52.836 A:middle
laws of geometry have held up.

313
00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:56.446 A:middle
A 10 by 10 rectangle
indeed has an area of 100.

314
00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:01.816 A:middle
Now, once you have properties
and methods on structs,

315
00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:05.076 A:middle
why not have them conform
to protocols, all right?

316
00:16:06.056 --> 00:16:08.816 A:middle
And this is really, you know,
a really powerful concept.

317
00:16:08.816 --> 00:16:10.906 A:middle
So, I can also have
CGRect conform

318
00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:11.876 A:middle
to the scale of protocol.

319
00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:13.956 A:middle
It's a, it's kind of a, it's
a graphical entity as well,

320
00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:18.246 A:middle
and I could also, you know,
I can now call this method

321
00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:19.856 A:middle
and scale up the
rectangle I created.

322
00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:21.436 A:middle
Now I have a 20,
20 by 20 rectangle.

323
00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:25.746 A:middle
So, now we have uniform
capabilities between classes

324
00:16:25.746 --> 00:16:28.836 A:middle
and structs, methods,
properties, and protocols.

325
00:16:29.816 --> 00:16:32.726 A:middle
So, now I have the power to
write some really generic code.

326
00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.306 A:middle
Let's say I want to
write a function,

327
00:16:35.846 --> 00:16:37.236 A:middle
scale by sizing factor.

328
00:16:37.946 --> 00:16:41.146 A:middle
It takes an arrayable
array of scalable things

329
00:16:42.266 --> 00:16:44.406 A:middle
and it returns a new
array of the, you know,

330
00:16:44.406 --> 00:16:46.356 A:middle
those elements scaled
up by some factor.

331
00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:50.516 A:middle
I can use that, I can
implement this very easily

332
00:16:50.516 --> 00:16:53.876 A:middle
for both structs and
classes using generics.

333
00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:57.256 A:middle
A generic function
looks almost identical

334
00:16:57.256 --> 00:17:00.886 A:middle
to a regular function except
it has this additional bit of,

335
00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.806 A:middle
of type information
where I'm supposed

336
00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:04.955 A:middle
to find a placeholder type T.

337
00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:07.876 A:middle
And all that matters
is that T conforms

338
00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:09.955 A:middle
to the scalable protocol,
whatever it happens to be.

339
00:17:11.526 --> 00:17:13.636 A:middle
The rest of the function looks
pretty much as you expect.

340
00:17:13.955 --> 00:17:17.175 A:middle
It's going to take an array of
T, which, whatever T happens

341
00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:20.816 A:middle
to be when I call this function,
it takes the scaling factor

342
00:17:21.586 --> 00:17:23.935 A:middle
and returns in a
new array of Ts.

343
00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:27.496 A:middle
Now, all I want to do is I
want to create a new array

344
00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:28.986 A:middle
in which each element
is scaled up.

345
00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:33.186 A:middle
I'm going to use the functional
map algorithm on array,

346
00:17:33.976 --> 00:17:37.176 A:middle
which takes a clojure to do the
transformation on each element

347
00:17:37.576 --> 00:17:38.776 A:middle
when constructed in a new array.

348
00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:41.316 A:middle
The clojure syntax
looks like this.

349
00:17:41.316 --> 00:17:43.476 A:middle
It, it's akin to
blocks in Objective-C.

350
00:17:44.526 --> 00:17:48.216 A:middle
And we think clojures are so
important that we wanted them

351
00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:49.326 A:middle
to feel really great,

352
00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:51.306 A:middle
syntactically optimized
in a language.

353
00:17:52.086 --> 00:17:54.326 A:middle
So, if the clojure is the
last argument to the function

354
00:17:54.326 --> 00:17:57.376 A:middle
or method, you can use this
really selective trailing

355
00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.506 A:middle
clojure syntax where
you can omit the,

356
00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:01.286 A:middle
the parentheses around
the clojure.

357
00:18:02.926 --> 00:18:03.576 A:middle
And that's it.

358
00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:06.336 A:middle
That's my three-line
generic function.

359
00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:10.976 A:middle
I can use it now to scale
up an array of NSFonts.

360
00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:14.206 A:middle
They're twice the size of
the ones I created before.

361
00:18:15.496 --> 00:18:19.396 A:middle
Similarly, I can call the same
function and scale up an array

362
00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:21.986 A:middle
of structs, completely
different data types,

363
00:18:22.306 --> 00:18:24.096 A:middle
but they just conform to
the scalable protocol,

364
00:18:25.156 --> 00:18:26.366 A:middle
and it works as expected.

365
00:18:27.546 --> 00:18:30.576 A:middle
This uniform capability is
between structs and classes

366
00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.056 A:middle
with methods, properties,
and protocols.

367
00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:35.116 A:middle
This thing is going to really
finally change how expressive

368
00:18:35.446 --> 00:18:36.336 A:middle
your code can be.

369
00:18:36.336 --> 00:18:38.366 A:middle
And we can't wait to see
what you can build with it.

370
00:18:39.116 --> 00:18:41.456 A:middle
Now, this ends what I'm going
to show you in the REPL.

371
00:18:41.526 --> 00:18:43.076 A:middle
I'm going to switch the slides

372
00:18:43.076 --> 00:18:46.116 A:middle
and tell you a few more exciting
things about the Swift language.

373
00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:59.756 A:middle
OK. So, as we saw in the
REPL, in, it is really easy

374
00:18:59.756 --> 00:19:02.626 A:middle
to write natural
and expressive code

375
00:19:02.626 --> 00:19:05.646 A:middle
in Swift while readily
tapping into some

376
00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:08.676 A:middle
of the language's most powerful
features, like generics.

377
00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:12.256 A:middle
And as you saw, it's really
crafted to work beautifully

378
00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:14.456 A:middle
with Cocoa and Cocoa touch.

379
00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:17.336 A:middle
Now, there are many advanced
features in the language

380
00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:19.326 A:middle
that I didn't talk
about in the REPL.

381
00:19:20.436 --> 00:19:22.626 A:middle
One of them of particular
importance that I wanted

382
00:19:22.626 --> 00:19:24.266 A:middle
to mention are modules.

383
00:19:25.416 --> 00:19:26.056 A:middle
What is a module?

384
00:19:27.196 --> 00:19:29.256 A:middle
It's a logical collection
of code

385
00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:31.656 A:middle
that is intended to
be built together.

386
00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:35.526 A:middle
So, for example, any framework
you build, any target you build

387
00:19:35.526 --> 00:19:39.176 A:middle
in Xcode, automatically gets
a module associated with it.

388
00:19:39.786 --> 00:19:44.256 A:middle
And one thing you get from
modules are implicit namespaces.

389
00:19:45.626 --> 00:19:48.076 A:middle
This means you no longer
have to prefix the name

390
00:19:48.076 --> 00:19:50.396 A:middle
of your classes anymore for fear

391
00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:51.976 A:middle
of them conflicting
with somebody else's.

392
00:19:52.516 --> 00:19:57.826 A:middle
[ Applause ]

393
00:19:58.326 --> 00:20:02.316 A:middle
Now, a really great
feature we did touch

394
00:20:02.316 --> 00:20:05.566 A:middle
on in the REPL demo were
Clojures, or non-S functions.

395
00:20:05.616 --> 00:20:09.836 A:middle
They're extremely powerful in
Swift, and they work beautifully

396
00:20:10.206 --> 00:20:12.506 A:middle
with blocks-based APIs in Cocoa.

397
00:20:13.116 --> 00:20:14.546 A:middle
And we think they're
so important

398
00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.816 A:middle
that we've syntactically
optimized them so that was

399
00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:19.096 A:middle
like those one-liners that
you want to write, you know,

400
00:20:19.096 --> 00:20:21.116 A:middle
to do something simple,
can be written

401
00:20:21.116 --> 00:20:25.036 A:middle
with very little code while
maintaining readability.

402
00:20:26.816 --> 00:20:29.786 A:middle
And because Cocoa-based,
you know,

403
00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:34.246 A:middle
blocks APIs in Objective-C will
reflect as Clojure-based APIs

404
00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:37.686 A:middle
in Swift, APIs

405
00:20:37.686 --> 00:20:40.686 A:middle
like dispatchasync
will read beautifully

406
00:20:40.686 --> 00:20:42.106 A:middle
with a trailing Clojure syntax.

407
00:20:42.396 --> 00:20:45.246 A:middle
In this case, dispatchasync
reads like control flow,

408
00:20:45.866 --> 00:20:49.046 A:middle
which is more how the API
was intended to be used.

409
00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:52.286 A:middle
So, we think this really changes
the readability of your code

410
00:20:52.286 --> 00:20:55.396 A:middle
and how you reason about it.

411
00:20:55.396 --> 00:20:59.036 A:middle
And perhaps the biggest
feature of Swift is

412
00:20:59.036 --> 00:21:02.766 A:middle
that it's fundamentally a
thin language under the hood

413
00:21:03.976 --> 00:21:07.146 A:middle
with much the functionality
not baked into the compiler

414
00:21:07.816 --> 00:21:10.626 A:middle
but defined in a
Core runtime library,

415
00:21:10.766 --> 00:21:12.576 A:middle
which itself is written
in Swift.

416
00:21:13.496 --> 00:21:16.246 A:middle
To give you an example of what
I mean, Core things like int

417
00:21:16.826 --> 00:21:19.906 A:middle
and array are defined
in this runtime library.

418
00:21:19.906 --> 00:21:21.406 A:middle
They're not baked
into the compiler.

419
00:21:22.816 --> 00:21:25.336 A:middle
Thus, the language is really
designed from the ground

420
00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:28.276 A:middle
up to be extensible,
composable, layerable,

421
00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:30.166 A:middle
to build new things out of it.

422
00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:35.146 A:middle
And we think this really
embraces the soul and spirit

423
00:21:35.526 --> 00:21:38.166 A:middle
of Cocoa and Cocoa
Touch, where rich APIs

424
00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:40.796 A:middle
and rich frameworks can
be combined together

425
00:21:40.796 --> 00:21:44.346 A:middle
to build really truly awesome
behaviors in technologies.

426
00:21:47.016 --> 00:21:49.986 A:middle
Now, the Swift language is full
of a ton of great features,

427
00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:50.616 A:middle
which we think are going

428
00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:55.186 A:middle
to fundamentally change how you
think about and craft your code.

429
00:21:56.306 --> 00:21:59.966 A:middle
But beyond that, we designed
the language with the intention

430
00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:00.836 A:middle
that it would be the basis

431
00:22:00.836 --> 00:22:03.706 A:middle
for truly fantastic
interactive tools.

432
00:22:05.356 --> 00:22:07.366 A:middle
In Xcode 6, we have
a new feature,

433
00:22:07.776 --> 00:22:09.006 A:middle
Interactive Playgrounds.

434
00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:12.306 A:middle
They're akin to the
REPL in that it's

435
00:22:12.366 --> 00:22:13.906 A:middle
like a lightweight
coding environment,

436
00:22:14.116 --> 00:22:16.816 A:middle
but it brings forth
the full capabilities

437
00:22:16.816 --> 00:22:20.246 A:middle
and rich experiences that we
can only deliver in Xcode.

438
00:22:21.346 --> 00:22:24.696 A:middle
And to show you more, I yield
the stage to Max Drukman.

439
00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:32.606 A:middle
[ Applause ]

440
00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:35.036 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Let me show you a little
bit of what you can do

441
00:22:35.276 --> 00:22:37.856 A:middle
with Playgrounds in Xcode 6.

442
00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:41.966 A:middle
So, I'm going to start
off with a new Playground.

443
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:47.546 A:middle
I think I'll make
this a little bigger

444
00:22:48.086 --> 00:22:49.586 A:middle
so we have a little
room to roam.

445
00:22:50.456 --> 00:22:53.166 A:middle
Playgrounds start you out
with Cocoa already imported

446
00:22:53.166 --> 00:22:55.206 A:middle
and a string variable
for you to play with.

447
00:22:55.206 --> 00:22:58.486 A:middle
I'm going to change mine to
something a little more topical.

448
00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:02.376 A:middle
How about that?

449
00:23:02.376 --> 00:23:09.076 A:middle
Now I'm going to add, how
about a date constant?

450
00:23:09.156 --> 00:23:12.186 A:middle
Pretty simple stuff, but you
can see on the right side

451
00:23:12.186 --> 00:23:14.306 A:middle
of the editor, I'm
getting results

452
00:23:14.306 --> 00:23:15.726 A:middle
as I enter lines of code.

453
00:23:16.436 --> 00:23:18.256 A:middle
That is the results area.

454
00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:21.986 A:middle
I know it's a brilliant name,
but just like in the REPL,

455
00:23:22.256 --> 00:23:26.606 A:middle
as you enter code, it gets
evaluated and you get results.

456
00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:30.116 A:middle
So, if I were to do
something like style

457
00:23:30.116 --> 00:23:35.076 A:middle
that string, I get the result.

458
00:23:35.076 --> 00:23:36.186 A:middle
My string is styled.

459
00:23:36.506 --> 00:23:39.556 A:middle
Now, you don't have to take
my word for it because many

460
00:23:39.556 --> 00:23:42.846 A:middle
of the results in the
Playground can be Quick Looked.

461
00:23:43.826 --> 00:23:46.126 A:middle
The Quick Looks in the
playground are just like those

462
00:23:46.126 --> 00:23:47.146 A:middle
in the Xcode debugger.

463
00:23:48.466 --> 00:23:51.456 A:middle
You can even implement your
own for custom data types.

464
00:23:52.616 --> 00:23:55.276 A:middle
They're a great way
to see results

465
00:23:55.276 --> 00:23:58.736 A:middle
that aren't great candidates
for coming across in plain text,

466
00:23:58.886 --> 00:24:03.216 A:middle
like this attributed
string or images.

467
00:24:03.846 --> 00:24:06.896 A:middle
So, just like my
attributed string,

468
00:24:07.076 --> 00:24:11.256 A:middle
I can Quick Look these images,
but we've added a way for you

469
00:24:11.306 --> 00:24:14.236 A:middle
to see the results
of your Playground

470
00:24:14.366 --> 00:24:18.196 A:middle
in a more persistent fashion
by adding your results

471
00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:19.976 A:middle
to the Timeline Assistant.

472
00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:24.486 A:middle
Now, the Timeline
Assistant allows you to build

473
00:24:24.486 --> 00:24:27.256 A:middle
up a persistent representation
of the results

474
00:24:27.256 --> 00:24:30.246 A:middle
of your Playground so
you can really get a feel

475
00:24:30.476 --> 00:24:32.106 A:middle
for what your code is doing.

476
00:24:33.446 --> 00:24:36.956 A:middle
The next thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to mask that image

477
00:24:37.346 --> 00:24:39.316 A:middle
with a Bezier path
that I'll create.

478
00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:47.856 A:middle
Now, because Bezier paths are
created in multiple steps,

479
00:24:49.106 --> 00:24:55.596 A:middle
they're a great candidate for
visualizing in the timeline.

480
00:24:55.686 --> 00:24:58.676 A:middle
I can simply add each of
the steps to the timeline

481
00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:03.136 A:middle
and get a great sense of
how my path is constructed.

482
00:25:03.786 --> 00:25:06.276 A:middle
And it's especially good

483
00:25:06.576 --> 00:25:10.256 A:middle
for spotting how one
bad value can have

484
00:25:10.356 --> 00:25:11.896 A:middle
ripple-effect consequences.

485
00:25:12.396 --> 00:25:15.386 A:middle
I'm going to undo that one.

486
00:25:15.676 --> 00:25:17.696 A:middle
I think I'll get rid of
most of these, actually.

487
00:25:18.336 --> 00:25:20.926 A:middle
I'll just leave the
final result.

488
00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:28.016 A:middle
Now, as I said, I want to
mask my image with this path.

489
00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:29.176 A:middle
So, I'll do that here.

490
00:25:29.836 --> 00:25:32.896 A:middle
I'm also adding in my
attributed string to the mask

491
00:25:34.486 --> 00:25:36.796 A:middle
so that it's punched
out of the center.

492
00:25:37.426 --> 00:25:43.076 A:middle
So, the timeline is great for
getting a sense of how your code

493
00:25:43.076 --> 00:25:45.686 A:middle
and how your views are
doing, but it does more

494
00:25:45.686 --> 00:25:47.216 A:middle
than just present static views.

495
00:25:47.606 --> 00:25:51.856 A:middle
It can also render them live,
which is great for animation,

496
00:25:52.366 --> 00:25:53.806 A:middle
which is what I'm
going to do next.

497
00:25:55.016 --> 00:25:57.896 A:middle
To do that, I'll just import
a little bit more API.

498
00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:00.456 A:middle
See how simple this is?

499
00:26:01.376 --> 00:26:02.556 A:middle
Especially when you
don't have to type.

500
00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:07.756 A:middle
And I add in a little code
that takes my two images,

501
00:26:08.086 --> 00:26:12.016 A:middle
one that's been masked, applies
it on top of the other one,

502
00:26:12.506 --> 00:26:14.776 A:middle
and makes it animate
with Core Animation.

503
00:26:15.446 --> 00:26:21.646 A:middle
Now, as Chris showed you
earlier, you can also move

504
00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:23.796 A:middle
around in time in the timeline.

505
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:27.056 A:middle
So, I can move back
and I can scrub

506
00:26:27.056 --> 00:26:29.576 A:middle
around to really
get a good sense

507
00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:31.086 A:middle
of how my animation is working.

508
00:26:31.766 --> 00:26:37.026 A:middle
Now, the, the next thing I
want to do is I want to add

509
00:26:38.066 --> 00:26:40.986 A:middle
that date I created
earlier to my mask,

510
00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:47.846 A:middle
and I'll do that up here, and
we can all cross our fingers

511
00:26:47.846 --> 00:26:49.586 A:middle
as I type live onstage.

512
00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:56.256 A:middle
How about that?

513
00:26:57.586 --> 00:26:58.946 A:middle
So, well, hmm.

514
00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:00.976 A:middle
I, OK, so I've added my date,

515
00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:02.986 A:middle
but that doesn't
look all that great.

516
00:27:03.446 --> 00:27:06.346 A:middle
Let's see if I can
make that look better

517
00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:09.716 A:middle
by reducing the font size.

518
00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:12.686 A:middle
Well, that's an awfully
big date.

519
00:27:13.816 --> 00:27:16.356 A:middle
I think what I want to do is I
want to make that date shorter,

520
00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:20.306 A:middle
and I'm betting NSDate has
some help for me there.

521
00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:25.656 A:middle
So, as with any class in Xcode,
I can command click on the,

522
00:27:25.656 --> 00:27:27.476 A:middle
the name of that class
to jump to the header.

523
00:27:28.276 --> 00:27:30.386 A:middle
In this case, I'll
command double click

524
00:27:30.536 --> 00:27:31.796 A:middle
to open it in a new window.

525
00:27:32.446 --> 00:27:37.576 A:middle
Now, notice that this doesn't
look like an Objective-C header.

526
00:27:38.216 --> 00:27:40.516 A:middle
It isn't. It's Swift.

527
00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:44.866 A:middle
That's because Xcode
creates Swift versions

528
00:27:44.986 --> 00:27:47.806 A:middle
of Objective-C headers
for you, so you don't have

529
00:27:47.836 --> 00:27:48.696 A:middle
to translate [applause].

530
00:27:49.406 --> 00:27:49.806 A:middle
That's right.

531
00:27:54.226 --> 00:27:57.246 A:middle
So you don't have to translate
what you see in the header

532
00:27:57.246 --> 00:27:59.026 A:middle
to what you implement
in your code.

533
00:28:00.236 --> 00:28:02.276 A:middle
Now, I have to come clean.

534
00:28:02.926 --> 00:28:05.556 A:middle
I don't know all that
much about NSDate.

535
00:28:06.666 --> 00:28:09.216 A:middle
So, looking at the header, well,

536
00:28:09.216 --> 00:28:10.756 A:middle
that's not really
doing enough for me.

537
00:28:11.506 --> 00:28:15.026 A:middle
Luckily, in Xcode, we have
lots of great sample code

538
00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:17.046 A:middle
and documentation
to help me out.

539
00:28:18.486 --> 00:28:24.006 A:middle
But wouldn't it be great if
you could combine the sort

540
00:28:24.006 --> 00:28:29.016 A:middle
of hands-on, do-it-yourself
style of sample code and the,

541
00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:33.036 A:middle
the sort of show-me-how-to-do-it
style of documentation?

542
00:28:33.646 --> 00:28:36.946 A:middle
Yes. Yes, it would.

543
00:28:38.586 --> 00:28:43.216 A:middle
That's why we created
Documentation Playgrounds.

544
00:28:45.516 --> 00:28:54.996 A:middle
[ Applause ]

545
00:28:55.496 --> 00:28:58.816 A:middle
Documentation Playgrounds
combine the best of both worlds.

546
00:28:59.176 --> 00:29:02.066 A:middle
Because it's a playground,
I can play.

547
00:29:02.676 --> 00:29:04.166 A:middle
But because it's documentation,

548
00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:06.056 A:middle
I get adult supervision
[laughter].

549
00:29:09.026 --> 00:29:11.726 A:middle
So, here is a Documentation
Playground talking

550
00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:13.906 A:middle
about converting between
dates and strings,

551
00:29:15.036 --> 00:29:16.636 A:middle
and here's what I'm looking for.

552
00:29:16.636 --> 00:29:18.456 A:middle
It's talking about
date formatters.

553
00:29:18.516 --> 00:29:19.906 A:middle
I'm pretty sure that's
what I want.

554
00:29:20.716 --> 00:29:23.526 A:middle
And it even very
handily tells me

555
00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:26.776 A:middle
to try setting different
values for time and date style.

556
00:29:27.526 --> 00:29:31.776 A:middle
And even more handy, it even
gives me the enums to try.

557
00:29:33.076 --> 00:29:34.326 A:middle
So, let's see.

558
00:29:34.326 --> 00:29:37.816 A:middle
I'm betting short style is
what I'm after, so all I have

559
00:29:37.816 --> 00:29:40.236 A:middle
to do is copy and paste,

560
00:29:40.876 --> 00:29:43.406 A:middle
and I can see my result
change in the timeline.

561
00:29:43.756 --> 00:29:44.676 A:middle
That's getting close.

562
00:29:45.256 --> 00:29:47.456 A:middle
Let's try this one.

563
00:29:47.656 --> 00:29:50.006 A:middle
Awesome! That's exactly
what I'm looking for.

564
00:29:51.506 --> 00:29:53.376 A:middle
Don't you want all
documentation to work this way?

565
00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:59.856 A:middle
So, now I know how to format my
date, and it's a simple matter

566
00:29:59.856 --> 00:30:01.826 A:middle
of doing that in my Playground.

567
00:30:02.516 --> 00:30:05.996 A:middle
I'm going to do that by
replacing a bunch of this code

568
00:30:06.996 --> 00:30:12.186 A:middle
with some code that has
my shortened date in it.

569
00:30:13.076 --> 00:30:21.036 A:middle
Hello. And my, my
fancy, there you go.

570
00:30:22.236 --> 00:30:25.336 A:middle
There it is.

571
00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:28.646 A:middle
Now my view is looking
exactly like what I wanted.

572
00:30:29.696 --> 00:30:34.146 A:middle
That's a small taste of
Swift Playgrounds in Xcode 6.

573
00:30:34.556 --> 00:30:36.636 A:middle
We think you're going to
love playing with your code.

574
00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:38.346 A:middle
Back to you, Andreas.

575
00:30:39.516 --> 00:30:46.956 A:middle
[ Applause ]

576
00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:48.056 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Max.

577
00:30:48.816 --> 00:30:50.306 A:middle
So, now that you
know a little bit

578
00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:52.306 A:middle
about what the Swift
coding language is,

579
00:30:52.446 --> 00:30:53.526 A:middle
how do you start using it?

580
00:30:54.136 --> 00:30:55.766 A:middle
Well, I made that
really easy for you.

581
00:30:56.686 --> 00:30:58.416 A:middle
Swift uses the same object model

582
00:30:58.576 --> 00:31:01.066 A:middle
and the same memory management
approach as Objective-C.

583
00:31:01.066 --> 00:31:05.606 A:middle
You can import all our system
APIs directly into Swift.

584
00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:09.716 A:middle
Foundation collections
are transparently bridged

585
00:31:10.026 --> 00:31:11.956 A:middle
to Swift language
arrays and dictionaries,

586
00:31:12.886 --> 00:31:13.736 A:middle
and we even went ahead

587
00:31:13.736 --> 00:31:16.356 A:middle
and modernized our
existing Objective-C APIs

588
00:31:16.736 --> 00:31:19.326 A:middle
so that they interact more
naturally for Swift code.

589
00:31:19.326 --> 00:31:22.766 A:middle
So, you can adopt
Swift at your own pace,

590
00:31:22.956 --> 00:31:24.556 A:middle
if you would like, file by file.

591
00:31:24.926 --> 00:31:27.046 A:middle
You can mix and match
Objective-C

592
00:31:27.046 --> 00:31:28.696 A:middle
and Swift in the same project.

593
00:31:30.786 --> 00:31:33.176 A:middle
We also wrote some great
documentation for you.

594
00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:36.436 A:middle
There's an entire new book
about Swift that you will find

595
00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:37.926 A:middle
in the iBookstore for free.

596
00:31:38.956 --> 00:31:41.436 A:middle
And we, of course, updated
our reference documentation

597
00:31:41.616 --> 00:31:44.826 A:middle
to cover all our APIs in
both Swift and Objective-C.

598
00:31:46.406 --> 00:31:48.056 A:middle
Now I know that all of
you guys really wanted

599
00:31:48.056 --> 00:31:51.536 A:middle
to be the first ones to submit
a Swift app to the App Store,

600
00:31:51.936 --> 00:31:53.786 A:middle
and I'm very sorry to
have to disappoint you,

601
00:31:53.856 --> 00:31:57.476 A:middle
but we've already done that
because, because this afternoon,

602
00:31:57.596 --> 00:32:00.946 A:middle
we're updating the WWDC app,
the app that you guys are using

603
00:32:00.946 --> 00:32:02.336 A:middle
to get around here
at the conference,

604
00:32:02.686 --> 00:32:04.226 A:middle
with a version that uses Swift.

605
00:32:04.376 --> 00:32:06.246 A:middle
So, this language is
ready for you to use.

606
00:32:06.246 --> 00:32:06.796 A:middle
It's real.

607
00:32:08.506 --> 00:32:10.886 A:middle
Now, one thing that is really
important to understand is

608
00:32:10.886 --> 00:32:13.686 A:middle
that we are planning to evolve
this language very rapidly.

609
00:32:13.886 --> 00:32:15.926 A:middle
Among other things, we really
want to hear what you have

610
00:32:15.926 --> 00:32:17.916 A:middle
to say about it and
incorporate your feedback

611
00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:18.846 A:middle
as much as possible.

612
00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:22.216 A:middle
And so we are not going to
promise source compatibility

613
00:32:22.376 --> 00:32:23.556 A:middle
between Xcode releases.

614
00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:27.586 A:middle
Some source conversion might be
necessary, and we'll do our best

615
00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:30.176 A:middle
to provide converters on the
way if we make major changes.

616
00:32:30.496 --> 00:32:34.066 A:middle
But the one thing we will
promise is binary compatibility

617
00:32:34.066 --> 00:32:35.986 A:middle
for your Swift apps because
we want you to be able

618
00:32:35.986 --> 00:32:37.466 A:middle
to try it without delay.

619
00:32:38.006 --> 00:32:41.236 A:middle
So, when we ship Xcode 6 later
this year, you will be able

620
00:32:41.236 --> 00:32:43.096 A:middle
to submit your Swift
apps to the App Store.

621
00:32:44.406 --> 00:32:47.306 A:middle
And they will run, your apps
will run on iOS 7 and later,

622
00:32:47.826 --> 00:32:49.316 A:middle
and OS X Mavericks and later.

623
00:32:49.536 --> 00:32:52.226 A:middle
So, Swift apps are not
limited to iOS 8 and Yosemite.

624
00:32:53.516 --> 00:33:00.186 A:middle
[ Applause ]

625
00:33:00.686 --> 00:33:02.866 A:middle
So, we are, as you can
probably imagine, really,

626
00:33:02.866 --> 00:33:04.176 A:middle
really excited about Swift.

627
00:33:04.336 --> 00:33:06.676 A:middle
We think it's quickly going to
become the programming language

628
00:33:06.676 --> 00:33:09.376 A:middle
of choice for our own
code as well as your apps.

629
00:33:09.866 --> 00:33:12.466 A:middle
We're looking very much forward
to hear what you think about.

630
00:33:14.556 --> 00:33:16.116 A:middle
Next we're going to
talk about gaming.

631
00:33:16.286 --> 00:33:17.666 A:middle
This is another technology area

632
00:33:17.666 --> 00:33:19.236 A:middle
that you are pushing
on very strongly.

633
00:33:19.236 --> 00:33:22.866 A:middle
We have many great techno-,
technology advances to announce

634
00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:24.316 A:middle
in this area this year.

635
00:33:24.456 --> 00:33:26.006 A:middle
To tell you more about
it, I'm going to hand

636
00:33:26.006 --> 00:33:27.866 A:middle
over to Jeff Schtie
[assumed spelling].

637
00:33:28.516 --> 00:33:32.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

638
00:33:33.056 --> 00:33:33.806 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Andreas.

639
00:33:34.486 --> 00:33:38.936 A:middle
We have an amazing games
technology ecosystem with APIs,

640
00:33:39.826 --> 00:33:41.576 A:middle
tools, and hardware
that allow you

641
00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:43.876 A:middle
to all build brilliant games.

642
00:33:44.746 --> 00:33:45.326 A:middle
Let's take a look.

643
00:33:46.826 --> 00:33:47.476 A:middle
So, Game Center.

644
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.296 A:middle
It's our social gaming
network providing features

645
00:33:50.296 --> 00:33:54.776 A:middle
like achievements, leaderboards,
friends, and multiplayer.

646
00:33:56.156 --> 00:33:58.376 A:middle
Many of you are already taking
advantage of Game Center

647
00:33:58.376 --> 00:33:59.636 A:middle
to differentiate your game,

648
00:34:00.046 --> 00:34:02.806 A:middle
and we have great
engagement with Game Center.

649
00:34:02.806 --> 00:34:05.166 A:middle
In fact, last month we had

650
00:34:05.166 --> 00:34:08.576 A:middle
over 130 million
monthly active users.

651
00:34:08.576 --> 00:34:10.856 A:middle
So, that's Game Center.

652
00:34:11.966 --> 00:34:12.676 A:middle
Game Controllers.

653
00:34:13.266 --> 00:34:16.966 A:middle
Last year at WWDC, we
introduced Game Controllers,

654
00:34:16.966 --> 00:34:18.606 A:middle
the Game Controller MFI program

655
00:34:18.866 --> 00:34:22.476 A:middle
and the corresponding
APIs for iOS and OS X.

656
00:34:23.746 --> 00:34:25.946 A:middle
One year later, Game Controllers
are doing really well.

657
00:34:26.946 --> 00:34:30.005 A:middle
Thousands of games taking
advantage of Game Controllers

658
00:34:30.005 --> 00:34:32.886 A:middle
for both the best of
touch and button inputs.

659
00:34:34.275 --> 00:34:38.146 A:middle
We have Game Controller demo
stations at Apple Stores

660
00:34:38.146 --> 00:34:39.946 A:middle
like the one right
here in San Francisco,

661
00:34:39.946 --> 00:34:43.966 A:middle
and we're introducing
controller forwarding.

662
00:34:44.485 --> 00:34:46.886 A:middle
So, what is controller
forwarding?

663
00:34:47.846 --> 00:34:50.666 A:middle
Now you can take an iOS device,
snap it into a Game Controller,

664
00:34:50.876 --> 00:34:54.636 A:middle
and then use the integrated
inputs of both buttons

665
00:34:55.306 --> 00:34:57.326 A:middle
and motion to control
iPads and Macs.

666
00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:58.306 A:middle
It's pretty cool.

667
00:35:03.106 --> 00:35:03.996 A:middle
So that's Game Controllers.

668
00:35:04.926 --> 00:35:06.576 A:middle
So now let's talk about
our graphics APIs.

669
00:35:08.756 --> 00:35:11.936 A:middle
We have SpriteKit, we have add,
we're adding many new features

670
00:35:11.936 --> 00:35:13.486 A:middle
to both SpriteKit and SceneKit.

671
00:35:14.256 --> 00:35:17.396 A:middle
We're bringing SceneKit
to iOS, and of course,

672
00:35:17.396 --> 00:35:20.816 A:middle
we're very excited
about our low-overhead,

673
00:35:21.426 --> 00:35:23.226 A:middle
highly optimized Metal API.

674
00:35:26.016 --> 00:35:27.896 A:middle
So, new for this
year is a major push

675
00:35:27.896 --> 00:35:30.376 A:middle
to making building casual
games easier than ever.

676
00:35:30.376 --> 00:35:33.416 A:middle
And SpriteKit is
our 2D graphics API.

677
00:35:34.046 --> 00:35:37.396 A:middle
We're introducing new features
like per pixel collisions

678
00:35:37.716 --> 00:35:41.846 A:middle
in physics, field
forces, inverse kinematics

679
00:35:41.846 --> 00:35:44.066 A:middle
with constraints, and,
of course, Shaders.

680
00:35:46.016 --> 00:35:49.466 A:middle
SceneKit is kind of like
SpriteKit but for 3D,

681
00:35:49.466 --> 00:35:54.176 A:middle
making it simpler than ever
to produce 3D games, and,

682
00:35:54.176 --> 00:35:55.606 A:middle
of course, it's now on iOS.

683
00:35:57.046 --> 00:36:01.026 A:middle
New for this year in
SceneKit, you, sorry.

684
00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:05.986 A:middle
SceneKit has everything you
would expect from a 3D graphics,

685
00:36:05.986 --> 00:36:10.196 A:middle
high-level 3D graphics API, like
the ability to load, manipulate,

686
00:36:10.196 --> 00:36:12.096 A:middle
and render complex 3D scenes.

687
00:36:12.096 --> 00:36:14.626 A:middle
It has some of the
same great new features

688
00:36:14.856 --> 00:36:15.896 A:middle
as we have on SpriteKit.

689
00:36:16.606 --> 00:36:20.706 A:middle
But what's really cool is
you can integrate SceneKit

690
00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:21.396 A:middle
and SpriteKit.

691
00:36:21.776 --> 00:36:24.866 A:middle
You can take a 3D object
from SceneKit and use

692
00:36:24.866 --> 00:36:27.196 A:middle
that as a sprite in
SpriteKit with no overhead.

693
00:36:28.156 --> 00:36:31.866 A:middle
You can take the output of
a SpriteKit scene and use it

694
00:36:31.866 --> 00:36:33.596 A:middle
as a texter in SceneKit.

695
00:36:34.786 --> 00:36:35.706 A:middle
It's really, really cool.

696
00:36:35.706 --> 00:36:41.506 A:middle
So, I'd like to invite Jacques
up to help me show you a demo

697
00:36:41.506 --> 00:36:42.916 A:middle
of both SceneKit and SpriteKit.

698
00:36:44.516 --> 00:36:52.236 A:middle
[ Applause ]

699
00:36:52.736 --> 00:36:53.436 A:middle
So, let's say you want

700
00:36:53.436 --> 00:36:55.386 A:middle
to use the built-in Physics
system for collisions.

701
00:36:55.956 --> 00:36:57.656 A:middle
Last year, you may have
gotten something like this.

702
00:36:58.876 --> 00:37:01.466 A:middle
So, that's OK, but
it's not great.

703
00:37:02.026 --> 00:37:02.976 A:middle
So, why is this?

704
00:37:03.206 --> 00:37:05.966 A:middle
Well, if we turn on Physics
Debug Draw, what we'll see is

705
00:37:06.166 --> 00:37:09.586 A:middle
that the Physics bounding
box, boxes do not correspond

706
00:37:09.586 --> 00:37:11.116 A:middle
to the exact shape
of the sprites.

707
00:37:12.796 --> 00:37:15.896 A:middle
So, new for this year, you can
turn on perfect cell collisions,

708
00:37:16.176 --> 00:37:18.956 A:middle
and now SpriteKit can use
the sprites alpha mask

709
00:37:20.266 --> 00:37:22.256 A:middle
to create pixel-accurate
collisions.

710
00:37:22.986 --> 00:37:25.426 A:middle
This allows you to create
complex interactions

711
00:37:25.696 --> 00:37:28.096 A:middle
and build things like
gears or even machines.

712
00:37:31.866 --> 00:37:33.106 A:middle
We've also added field forces.

713
00:37:33.636 --> 00:37:35.506 A:middle
Here you see an, an
attractor interacting

714
00:37:35.506 --> 00:37:37.166 A:middle
with the sprites in the scene.

715
00:37:38.566 --> 00:37:40.476 A:middle
We can add a repulser and
see how the tube field forces

716
00:37:40.476 --> 00:37:41.846 A:middle
interact together
with the sprites,

717
00:37:41.846 --> 00:37:45.106 A:middle
and we've added many real
and imaginary field forces

718
00:37:45.106 --> 00:37:48.446 A:middle
like directional gravity,
black holes, magnets,

719
00:37:48.956 --> 00:37:50.876 A:middle
repulsers, and spring forces.

720
00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:55.936 A:middle
And, of course, we have
everything you need

721
00:37:56.136 --> 00:37:57.066 A:middle
for dynamic lighting.

722
00:37:58.166 --> 00:38:01.286 A:middle
One AB, here's a basic scene kit
scene and one API call can turn

723
00:38:01.286 --> 00:38:04.976 A:middle
on lighting, and of course,
you can select the object

724
00:38:04.976 --> 00:38:06.486 A:middle
in your scene which you'd
like to cast shadows.

725
00:38:09.806 --> 00:38:11.576 A:middle
And if you want to take
this to the next level,

726
00:38:11.576 --> 00:38:12.586 A:middle
you can add normal maps.

727
00:38:14.916 --> 00:38:17.456 A:middle
So, what we've done here,
with a single API call,

728
00:38:17.456 --> 00:38:19.616 A:middle
we've turned on normal maps.

729
00:38:19.616 --> 00:38:21.666 A:middle
SpriteKit uses the
existing artwork

730
00:38:21.836 --> 00:38:23.976 A:middle
to generate a normal map
automatically, so there's,

731
00:38:23.976 --> 00:38:25.406 A:middle
no extra art was added here.

732
00:38:26.006 --> 00:38:27.906 A:middle
This kind of, this
kind of dynamic,

733
00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:30.056 A:middle
dramatic element can
really add to your games.

734
00:38:33.346 --> 00:38:34.546 A:middle
So, let's take a look
at the integration

735
00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:35.736 A:middle
of SpriteKit with SceneKit.

736
00:38:36.156 --> 00:38:39.106 A:middle
So, here you have a SpriteKit
application you may recall

737
00:38:39.106 --> 00:38:39.726 A:middle
from last year.

738
00:38:39.726 --> 00:38:43.136 A:middle
What you can do now is take
a SceneKit node and put it

739
00:38:43.136 --> 00:38:45.866 A:middle
into the, into the
scene as a 3D object.

740
00:38:47.036 --> 00:38:49.256 A:middle
That, that allows
with no overhead

741
00:38:49.316 --> 00:38:50.736 A:middle
to get a, a tremendous result.

742
00:38:50.836 --> 00:38:52.636 A:middle
Here we've replaced
both the hero

743
00:38:52.636 --> 00:38:54.446 A:middle
and the alien with 3D objects.

744
00:38:55.136 --> 00:38:56.526 A:middle
So what does this
allow you to do?

745
00:38:56.526 --> 00:38:58.096 A:middle
You can design your game in 2D.

746
00:38:58.266 --> 00:39:00.896 A:middle
You can set up your complex
interactions all in 2D,

747
00:39:01.006 --> 00:39:02.496 A:middle
then you could add
your 3D assets

748
00:39:02.496 --> 00:39:04.406 A:middle
in to give your game
that extra pop.

749
00:39:04.616 --> 00:39:07.496 A:middle
So, that's SceneKit
with a SpriteKit.

750
00:39:08.796 --> 00:39:10.186 A:middle
Now, let's take a,
take a look at some

751
00:39:10.186 --> 00:39:11.286 A:middle
of the features of SceneKit.

752
00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:15.966 A:middle
As I said, SceneKit is kind
of like SpriteKit but for 3D.

753
00:39:15.966 --> 00:39:18.146 A:middle
It makes it simpler than
ever to build 3D games.

754
00:39:18.146 --> 00:39:20.376 A:middle
Now, let's take a tour
of some of the features.

755
00:39:20.876 --> 00:39:25.106 A:middle
Here we have an example of,
the built-in 3D Physics Engine.

756
00:39:25.106 --> 00:39:27.776 A:middle
You have the blocks and balls
colliding with each other

757
00:39:27.776 --> 00:39:28.956 A:middle
and also with the room itself.

758
00:39:29.696 --> 00:39:32.566 A:middle
This is, game is using the
3D, built-in 3D Physics Engine

759
00:39:32.566 --> 00:39:34.406 A:middle
and it's obviously
fully interactive.

760
00:39:34.736 --> 00:39:37.286 A:middle
And we have 3D field forces.

761
00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:40.536 A:middle
Here you have an attracter
in 3D, which is kind

762
00:39:40.536 --> 00:39:43.866 A:middle
of like a space vacuum creating
this really cool effect.

763
00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:46.406 A:middle
What's amazing is you can
just add a simple attracter

764
00:39:46.406 --> 00:39:48.676 A:middle
to your scene to create
this great effect.

765
00:39:49.276 --> 00:39:50.316 A:middle
No other work was necessary.

766
00:39:54.336 --> 00:39:56.576 A:middle
And you can combine
SceneKit and SpriteKit.

767
00:39:57.686 --> 00:39:59.036 A:middle
So, what are you seeing here?

768
00:39:59.616 --> 00:40:02.116 A:middle
So, the paintballs are
being shot into the scene

769
00:40:02.116 --> 00:40:05.016 A:middle
as 3D objects using the 3D
Collision System to collide

770
00:40:05.046 --> 00:40:06.786 A:middle
with the Taurus,
another 3D object.

771
00:40:07.216 --> 00:40:10.896 A:middle
We then take a paint splotch
sprite, say that 3 times fast,

772
00:40:11.436 --> 00:40:14.586 A:middle
and paste it into a SpriteKit
canvas off screen you don't see.

773
00:40:14.836 --> 00:40:17.796 A:middle
We take the results of that and
texture map it onto the Taurus,

774
00:40:18.336 --> 00:40:20.586 A:middle
so it creates this really
convincing, cool combination

775
00:40:20.586 --> 00:40:23.356 A:middle
of SpriteKit and SceneKit,
made possible by the,

776
00:40:23.356 --> 00:40:24.886 A:middle
the integration of these APIs.

777
00:40:27.456 --> 00:40:28.886 A:middle
And finally, of course,
you have shaders.

778
00:40:28.936 --> 00:40:31.996 A:middle
We have vertex, surface,
and fragment shaders.

779
00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:34.386 A:middle
Here you have a simple
vertex shader,

780
00:40:34.386 --> 00:40:36.976 A:middle
which is manipulating the
model's geometry in real time.

781
00:40:38.246 --> 00:40:41.196 A:middle
We have surface shaders where
you can effect the surface

782
00:40:41.546 --> 00:40:44.146 A:middle
and lighting properties
of our model,

783
00:40:44.146 --> 00:40:45.766 A:middle
here creating this
cool caustic effect.

784
00:40:47.296 --> 00:40:49.046 A:middle
And finally, fragment shaders,

785
00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:51.366 A:middle
which can create amazing
pixel-level effects

786
00:40:51.636 --> 00:40:53.096 A:middle
like this glass globe
effect here.

787
00:40:53.096 --> 00:40:56.106 A:middle
So, that's seeing a
couple of shaders.

788
00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.066 A:middle
Now, I'd like to take a minute

789
00:40:59.066 --> 00:41:02.956 A:middle
to have Jacques show you how
easy it is to enable some

790
00:41:02.956 --> 00:41:04.636 A:middle
of these features
using our Xcode tools.

791
00:41:04.946 --> 00:41:06.186 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jeff.

792
00:41:07.336 --> 00:41:10.116 A:middle
So, new in Xcode 6
are built-in tools

793
00:41:10.356 --> 00:41:11.516 A:middle
for SpriteKit and SceneKit.

794
00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:13.386 A:middle
You can edit content
right within Xcode.

795
00:41:13.386 --> 00:41:15.966 A:middle
I'm going to give you a
quick tour of that right now.

796
00:41:19.566 --> 00:41:22.356 A:middle
So, here we have the
SpriteKit editor in Xcode 6.

797
00:41:22.926 --> 00:41:25.536 A:middle
You see the per-pixel scene we
had from the iPad demo earlier.

798
00:41:25.536 --> 00:41:28.816 A:middle
I'm going to make some quick
edits to it in edit mode,

799
00:41:28.926 --> 00:41:31.576 A:middle
which I'm currently in, and then
I'm going to switch to simulate

800
00:41:31.576 --> 00:41:33.426 A:middle
in simulate mode to
see the physics live.

801
00:41:33.426 --> 00:41:37.206 A:middle
So, I'm going to go over here on
the right to my media library,

802
00:41:37.596 --> 00:41:39.796 A:middle
which includes all the
images inside my project.

803
00:41:39.796 --> 00:41:42.626 A:middle
I'm going to drop one of
these squirrels into here,

804
00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:47.316 A:middle
and I'm going to place it
using the new snap-in feature

805
00:41:48.236 --> 00:41:51.636 A:middle
and then I'm going
to simulate this.

806
00:41:52.456 --> 00:41:55.106 A:middle
Well, this behaves
pretty much as expected

807
00:41:55.106 --> 00:41:58.346 A:middle
because the blue rectangles
are the physics body outlines,

808
00:41:58.526 --> 00:41:59.716 A:middle
so this is not falling over.

809
00:41:59.716 --> 00:42:03.796 A:middle
I'm going to correct that by
turning on per-pixel physics,

810
00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:07.316 A:middle
which is as simple as selecting
the objects I want to use,

811
00:42:07.726 --> 00:42:09.276 A:middle
changing their physics
definition

812
00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:10.716 A:middle
to use the alpha mask.

813
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:16.236 A:middle
Then I'm going to simulate again
and the right thing happens.

814
00:42:17.936 --> 00:42:19.336 A:middle
OK, well that was easy.

815
00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:23.026 A:middle
Let's move on to showing you
the new feature of field forces.

816
00:42:23.966 --> 00:42:27.476 A:middle
So, field forces are super
easy to use inside Xcode,

817
00:42:27.966 --> 00:42:29.966 A:middle
and I implore you to try them
out and play with them here,

818
00:42:29.966 --> 00:42:32.206 A:middle
and it's one of the
best places to do that.

819
00:42:32.206 --> 00:42:34.636 A:middle
So, I'm going to drag a
theoretical field in here,

820
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:36.016 A:middle
called a spring field,

821
00:42:37.086 --> 00:42:39.296 A:middle
which acts as if there
was a spring connected

822
00:42:39.336 --> 00:42:41.426 A:middle
between the field
and any of the nodes

823
00:42:41.426 --> 00:42:42.376 A:middle
that I'm going to enable it on.

824
00:42:43.466 --> 00:42:44.766 A:middle
So, I'm going to pick
some of these balls here.

825
00:42:44.766 --> 00:42:47.136 A:middle
I'm going to enable the
spring field on them

826
00:42:47.776 --> 00:42:51.136 A:middle
by setting their physics field
mask to something other than 0.

827
00:42:51.136 --> 00:42:52.956 A:middle
I've done that.

828
00:42:52.956 --> 00:42:54.656 A:middle
Now I'm going to simulate this.

829
00:42:54.656 --> 00:42:57.236 A:middle
Well, you notice they all
drag towards the center

830
00:42:57.236 --> 00:43:00.326 A:middle
of the spring there, and you
notice also as they collided,

831
00:43:00.756 --> 00:43:02.796 A:middle
they collided with the
inert pulser not enabled

832
00:43:02.796 --> 00:43:03.486 A:middle
on the field mask.

833
00:43:04.196 --> 00:43:06.436 A:middle
So, they actually,
full physics running,

834
00:43:06.436 --> 00:43:08.896 A:middle
and the field only affecting
the balls I selected.

835
00:43:10.076 --> 00:43:11.356 A:middle
Super easy and fun to use.

836
00:43:13.086 --> 00:43:16.246 A:middle
Next up, I want to
take you through how

837
00:43:16.246 --> 00:43:18.526 A:middle
to put 3D content inside
your SpriteKit scene.

838
00:43:19.026 --> 00:43:20.886 A:middle
So, just bear with me while
I go through the steps here.

839
00:43:21.606 --> 00:43:22.166 A:middle
All right.

840
00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:26.886 A:middle
I'm going to drag
that ship in and dump.

841
00:43:27.926 --> 00:43:32.256 A:middle
All right, so that was
step 1, 2, and that's it.

842
00:43:32.256 --> 00:43:33.196 A:middle
You can see it's 3D.

843
00:43:33.366 --> 00:43:36.346 A:middle
I'm going to try that again
in case you missed it.

844
00:43:37.626 --> 00:43:39.306 A:middle
So, here we go.

845
00:43:39.306 --> 00:43:40.706 A:middle
An alien. OK.

846
00:43:41.156 --> 00:43:42.826 A:middle
So, step 1, that's
everything you need.

847
00:43:43.516 --> 00:43:45.136 A:middle
So, this is just a
quick preview of some

848
00:43:45.136 --> 00:43:46.896 A:middle
of the great new features
we've added to SpriteKit

849
00:43:46.896 --> 00:43:48.206 A:middle
and SceneKit in Xcode 6.

850
00:43:48.866 --> 00:43:49.396 A:middle
Thank you so much.

[ Applause ]

853
00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:57.876 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So, thank you, Jacques.

854
00:43:58.366 --> 00:44:01.186 A:middle
So, that was some of our
high-level, high-performance,

855
00:44:01.186 --> 00:44:03.516 A:middle
super-efficient 2D
and 3D games API.

856
00:44:04.416 --> 00:44:06.406 A:middle
Now, let's go from
the high-level right

857
00:44:06.406 --> 00:44:07.326 A:middle
down to the GPU.

858
00:44:08.636 --> 00:44:11.386 A:middle
We've been optimizing the
heck out of the graphics stack

859
00:44:11.856 --> 00:44:14.666 A:middle
with a new, low-overhead
API Metal.

860
00:44:15.206 --> 00:44:16.086 A:middle
So, why is that?

861
00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:17.166 A:middle
What, what does that give you?

862
00:44:18.126 --> 00:44:20.646 A:middle
Well, many games want to
run at 60 frames per second.

863
00:44:22.216 --> 00:44:24.966 A:middle
So, a little bit of math
shows you that you have a bit

864
00:44:24.966 --> 00:44:27.406 A:middle
over 16 milliseconds
for every frame.

865
00:44:28.266 --> 00:44:31.576 A:middle
We put that on a timeline, what
we can see is that you have

866
00:44:31.626 --> 00:44:33.466 A:middle
to get all your application
work done,

867
00:44:34.126 --> 00:44:37.196 A:middle
you have to issue your drawing
calls, and the system framer has

868
00:44:37.196 --> 00:44:39.506 A:middle
to turn those drawing
calls into GPU commands all

869
00:44:39.506 --> 00:44:42.786 A:middle
within that 16 milliseconds or
you'll start to drop frames.

870
00:44:43.216 --> 00:44:46.636 A:middle
And of course that's just one of
a number of frames you have to,

871
00:44:46.636 --> 00:44:49.456 A:middle
you have to produce to make a
truly interactive experience.

872
00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:52.716 A:middle
So, let's expand
that first frame out.

873
00:44:53.496 --> 00:44:54.746 A:middle
You see, there's
two distinct parts.

874
00:44:54.746 --> 00:44:57.066 A:middle
The first part is the
application piece.

875
00:44:57.446 --> 00:45:00.736 A:middle
The second part is that system
framework, that GPU API.

876
00:45:01.316 --> 00:45:03.126 A:middle
Well, Metal is super-efficient

877
00:45:03.176 --> 00:45:05.576 A:middle
at reducing the second
part to the bare minimum.

878
00:45:05.576 --> 00:45:09.326 A:middle
So, what this gives
you is more time.

879
00:45:09.956 --> 00:45:12.366 A:middle
More time for AI,
more time for physics,

880
00:45:12.746 --> 00:45:14.116 A:middle
more time for more drawing,

881
00:45:14.456 --> 00:45:17.096 A:middle
more time to make your
game even more brilliant.

882
00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:23.396 A:middle
So, Metal allows you to
unlock the power of the GPU.

883
00:45:23.396 --> 00:45:26.706 A:middle
It gives you easy
access and full control

884
00:45:26.706 --> 00:45:27.806 A:middle
over the rendering pipeline.

885
00:45:27.806 --> 00:45:33.256 A:middle
It has features like the direct
control over the creation

886
00:45:33.466 --> 00:45:35.706 A:middle
and encoding of GPU
command buffers.

887
00:45:36.316 --> 00:45:38.036 A:middle
It also provides a
unified shading language

888
00:45:38.036 --> 00:45:40.736 A:middle
for both graphics and compute
with offline compilation.

I'm one of those first-time Mac

900
00:46:17.966 --> 00:46:20.486 A:middle
We've been building for
the last couple of weeks

901
00:46:20.556 --> 00:46:23.296 A:middle
and you render using Metal
for our game engine Frostbite.

902
00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:26.686 A:middle
Well, our goal with
using Metal, this new,

903
00:46:26.686 --> 00:46:30.166 A:middle

to try and enable the wide set

of capabilities of our
Frostbite engine on iOS.

One of the biggest changes we
saw with using Metal instead

918
00:47:28.136 --> 00:47:30.586 A:middle
of OpenGL was that our
rendering submission times

919
00:47:30.586 --> 00:47:32.236 A:middle
on the CPU became
five times faster.

920
00:47:32.786 --> 00:47:34.576 A:middle
This is really quite
impressive and it's a,

921
00:47:34.646 --> 00:47:37.216 A:middle
it's a really good benefit
because it frees up 80 percent

922
00:47:37.216 --> 00:47:39.606 A:middle

We're really happy with
the result we're getting,

932
00:48:20.866 --> 00:48:23.856 A:middle
and let's take a closer look at
some of the action we have here.

933
00:48:23.856 --> 00:48:26.606 A:middle
So, this is rendered in real
time in Frostbite with Metal

Nicholas here is moving
around with the camera.

936

And one of the key benefits
that we're getting from Metal is

937
00:48:34.596 --> 00:48:37.746 A:middle
that we get fine-grain control
over the GPU and overall system.

938
00:48:37.986 --> 00:48:39.936 A:middle
We can build command buffers
efficiently in parallel

939
00:48:40.006 --> 00:48:41.746 A:middle
and we can control them.

940
00:48:42.006 --> 00:48:44.156 A:middle
We can explicitly
manage GPU resources,

reduces overhead for us

give a significantly better

00:48:49.386 --> 00:48:50.436 A:middle
and stable frame rates.

944
00:48:51.306 --> 00:48:52.626 A:middle
Now, Nicholas has paused
in this scene here.

945
00:48:53.266 --> 00:48:54.386 A:middle
This is really quite
the interesting scene

946
00:48:54.386 --> 00:48:55.456 A:middle
with tons of stuff going on.

947
00:48:55.626 --> 00:48:57.586 A:middle
And there's tons of
V effects, debris,

948
00:48:57.586 --> 00:48:59.576 A:middle
and this large animated
character is interacting.

949
00:48:59.856 --> 00:49:02.216 A:middle
And there's a lot of components
coming together to be able

950
00:49:02.216 --> 00:49:03.416 A:middle
to create these type
of environments here.

951
00:49:04.286 --> 00:49:05.706 A:middle
And here we have
two very detailed

952
00:49:05.706 --> 00:49:08.196 A:middle
and great-looking characters,
sunflower and cactus.

953
00:49:08.696 --> 00:49:10.796 A:middle
We're running dynamic shadows
for everything in this scene

954
00:49:10.946 --> 00:49:12.736 A:middle
and not just the characters,
but everything really.

955
00:49:13.096 --> 00:49:15.816 A:middle
And this is really quite heavy
but it makes the characters

956
00:49:15.816 --> 00:49:17.166 A:middle
and everything fit in with the,

957
00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:18.976 A:middle
regardless of where the lighting
condition is in the environment.

958
00:49:24.866 --> 00:49:25.796 A:middle
Well, let's look at it again.

959
00:49:28.056 --> 00:49:32.246 A:middle
We've been working on, on this
for just a couple of weeks

960
00:49:32.396 --> 00:49:34.176 A:middle
but we're really quite
interested in all

961
00:49:34.176 --> 00:49:34.876 A:middle
of the results we're getting.

962
00:49:34.876 --> 00:49:35.686 A:middle
We're really happy about it.

963
00:49:35.686 --> 00:49:44.446 A:middle
So, yeah. Yeah, so here we have
the big animated robot again.

964
00:49:44.586 --> 00:49:45.356 A:middle
It's a zombie robot.

965
00:49:46.396 --> 00:49:48.526 A:middle
I'm not sure how that
works, but he seems

966
00:49:48.526 --> 00:49:49.516 A:middle
to be very well animated
[laughter].

967
00:49:51.716 --> 00:49:54.146 A:middle
So, we're rendering up to 1.2
million triangles per frame.

968
00:49:54.236 --> 00:49:55.746 A:middle
That's really quite a lot,

969
00:49:55.746 --> 00:49:56.976 A:middle
and we're really happy
that we can do that.

970
00:49:57.426 --> 00:49:58.626 A:middle
And together with that,

971
00:49:58.626 --> 00:50:00.356 A:middle
we're doing around 20
different rendering passes

972
00:50:00.356 --> 00:50:03.066 A:middle
for our HER rendering, for
shadows, for aimed occlusions,

973
00:50:03.456 --> 00:50:05.836 A:middle
for particles, and
for distortion.

974
00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:06.986 A:middle
And as you can see
in the background,

975
00:50:06.986 --> 00:50:09.016 A:middle
we have this nice [inaudible]
effect going on that sort

976
00:50:09.016 --> 00:50:10.566 A:middle
of frames the action
a little bit more.

977
00:50:11.806 --> 00:50:15.116 A:middle
And we're really happy that
we can, I'm really excited

978
00:50:15.116 --> 00:50:16.876 A:middle
and really impressed by the
amount of geometry and effects

979
00:50:16.876 --> 00:50:18.056 A:middle
that we can push
through the GPU.

980
00:50:18.636 --> 00:50:19.776 A:middle
It's really quite extraordinary.

981
00:50:20.696 --> 00:50:22.446 A:middle
And this enables us to
use the same content

982
00:50:22.446 --> 00:50:23.456 A:middle
and the same features
that we're using

983
00:50:23.456 --> 00:50:25.646 A:middle
for building console
games but here on iOS.

984
00:50:25.646 --> 00:50:28.526 A:middle
It makes it significantly
easier to,

985
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:29.876 A:middle
to work with this as a platform.

986
00:50:29.876 --> 00:50:32.346 A:middle
So, Metal for us is
literally a game changer.

987
00:50:32.736 --> 00:50:36.816 A:middle
It, it's a key enabler for a
new set of full 3D games on iOS,

988
00:50:36.816 --> 00:50:39.606 A:middle
and we at Electronic Arts are
super excited to support it

989
00:50:39.606 --> 00:50:41.276 A:middle
and put this in the
hands of our game teams

990
00:50:41.276 --> 00:50:42.066 A:middle
and see what they can create.

991
00:50:42.516 --> 00:50:42.796 A:middle
Thank you.

992
00:50:43.516 --> 00:50:51.946 A:middle
[ Applause ]

993
00:50:52.446 --> 00:50:53.746 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks to Johan
and Electronic Arts.

994
00:50:54.176 --> 00:50:55.406 A:middle
That was simply stunning.

995
00:50:55.406 --> 00:50:58.076 A:middle
It's amazing the
power of the GPU

996
00:50:58.356 --> 00:50:59.776 A:middle
that Metal allows you to unlock.

997
00:51:04.476 --> 00:51:07.286 A:middle
So, it has never been easier
to take an amazing idea

998
00:51:07.826 --> 00:51:10.756 A:middle
and to brilliant, build a
brilliantly successful game.

999
00:51:10.926 --> 00:51:13.756 A:middle
We can't wait to see what all
of you are going to build.

1000
00:51:14.046 --> 00:51:15.976 A:middle
Thank you very much, and I'll
hand it back over to Andreas

1001
00:51:16.036 --> 00:51:17.136 A:middle
to talk about extensions.

1002
00:51:18.516 --> 00:51:25.016 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1003
00:51:25.516 --> 00:51:25.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

1004
00:51:27.216 --> 00:51:30.196 A:middle
Extensions represent, represent
another very important new

1005
00:51:30.196 --> 00:51:31.936 A:middle
technology direction
that we are opening

1006
00:51:31.936 --> 00:51:34.686 A:middle
up for third-party developers
on both iOS and OS X.

1007
00:51:34.686 --> 00:51:39.066 A:middle
They represent the ability
to hook into various kind

1008
00:51:39.066 --> 00:51:41.556 A:middle
of system behaviors, and
they allow users to expand

1009
00:51:41.556 --> 00:51:44.246 A:middle
and customize our Core
operating system functionality.

1010
00:51:46.206 --> 00:51:48.856 A:middle
Extensions are bundles
that ship inside your apps.

1011
00:51:49.166 --> 00:51:51.046 A:middle
They get downloaded from the
App Store with your apps,

1012
00:51:51.196 --> 00:51:52.666 A:middle
and they get removed
from your system

1013
00:51:52.666 --> 00:51:54.016 A:middle
if you use an uninstall
to your apps.

1014
00:51:55.546 --> 00:51:57.026 A:middle
So that the user
doesn't get flooded

1015
00:51:57.026 --> 00:52:00.236 A:middle
with unexpected new behaviors,
they stay in full control

1016
00:52:00.236 --> 00:52:02.356 A:middle
of which extensions
are active in the UI.

1017
00:52:02.406 --> 00:52:05.536 A:middle
They get to expressly activate
each extension they wish to use.

1018
00:52:06.226 --> 00:52:08.116 A:middle
It uses insisted
preferences and settings.

1019
00:52:10.256 --> 00:52:12.906 A:middle
In technical terms,
extensions are short-lived,

1020
00:52:13.186 --> 00:52:16.826 A:middle
out-of-process services that get
launched by our OSs on demand.

1021
00:52:17.836 --> 00:52:20.136 A:middle
If configured to do
so, they can share data

1022
00:52:20.216 --> 00:52:22.346 A:middle
with the apps they are
embedded in, for example,

1023
00:52:22.346 --> 00:52:25.336 A:middle
to access keychain items or
any other kind of preferences.

1024
00:52:26.876 --> 00:52:28.526 A:middle
Extensions are of
course sandboxed,

1025
00:52:28.776 --> 00:52:31.606 A:middle
and we even developed this
cool new remote view technology

1026
00:52:32.076 --> 00:52:35.606 A:middle
that hosts an extensions user
interface inside our system apps

1027
00:52:36.076 --> 00:52:39.126 A:middle
and dispatches user events
back to the extensions process

1028
00:52:39.276 --> 00:52:41.016 A:middle
without the app being
able to see it.

1029
00:52:41.236 --> 00:52:43.336 A:middle
So extensions are
designed to be very secure.

1030
00:52:44.906 --> 00:52:47.136 A:middle
And since extensions
typically share a lot of code

1031
00:52:47.136 --> 00:52:49.136 A:middle
with their apps,
we now allow you

1032
00:52:49.246 --> 00:52:51.046 A:middle
to use bundled frameworks
on iOS.

1033
00:52:52.516 --> 00:52:57.336 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1034
00:52:57.836 --> 00:53:00.166 A:middle
So you're not limited
anymore to static libraries.

1035
00:53:00.166 --> 00:53:02.566 A:middle
You can now bundle
resources and binaries

1036
00:53:02.566 --> 00:53:03.976 A:middle
in fully supported frameworks.

1037
00:53:05.426 --> 00:53:07.256 A:middle
Now, here's a list of
the extension points

1038
00:53:07.376 --> 00:53:09.206 A:middle
that we are making
available in this year's iOS

1039
00:53:09.206 --> 00:53:12.666 A:middle
and OS X releases, and more
will follow in the future,

1040
00:53:12.946 --> 00:53:14.856 A:middle
but we think this is a
great starting point.

1041
00:53:15.546 --> 00:53:17.026 A:middle
Let's go over these
one after the other.

1042
00:53:17.026 --> 00:53:21.526 A:middle
There are many online services
out there that allow users

1043
00:53:21.526 --> 00:53:24.576 A:middle
to post comments or share
things like pictures and videos.

1044
00:53:25.636 --> 00:53:27.856 A:middle
And while we support the largest
ones directly in our OSs,

1045
00:53:27.856 --> 00:53:30.486 A:middle
we realize we can't
support them all.

1046
00:53:31.026 --> 00:53:33.136 A:middle
So, if you are running one
of these online services,

1047
00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:36.846 A:middle
sharing extensions are a great
way to let users post comments,

1048
00:53:37.046 --> 00:53:39.636 A:middle
links, and media to your service

1049
00:53:39.636 --> 00:53:41.416 A:middle
from within any app
they might be running.

1050
00:53:43.956 --> 00:53:47.276 A:middle
Actions allow you to take
user data, anything from text

1051
00:53:47.726 --> 00:53:50.886 A:middle
to images, audio, and more,
and transform that data

1052
00:53:50.886 --> 00:53:52.216 A:middle
into a new representation.

1053
00:53:52.906 --> 00:53:55.966 A:middle
For example, you could write an
extension that takes source code

1054
00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:58.426 A:middle
and Xcode and reformats
it to your wishes,

1055
00:53:58.886 --> 00:54:00.766 A:middle
perhaps with the
three-space indentation.

1056
00:54:03.596 --> 00:54:06.496 A:middle
And Photo Editing extensions are
actions that manipulate images,

1057
00:54:06.956 --> 00:54:08.856 A:middle
but we make sure that we
keep the original around so

1058
00:54:09.006 --> 00:54:10.436 A:middle
that edits are nondestructive.

1059
00:54:12.506 --> 00:54:14.956 A:middle
Safari actions manipulate
web pages.

1060
00:54:15.236 --> 00:54:16.776 A:middle
Now, they have a
lot of flexibility

1061
00:54:17.116 --> 00:54:20.546 A:middle
because they get accessed to the
full DOM on the way in and out.

1062
00:54:20.546 --> 00:54:23.916 A:middle
So they can completely re-render
an entire web page while the

1063
00:54:23.916 --> 00:54:24.806 A:middle
user is browsing.

1064
00:54:25.346 --> 00:54:27.036 A:middle
For example, to do a
language translation.

1065
00:54:29.216 --> 00:54:30.746 A:middle
Notification Center
widgets allow you

1066
00:54:30.916 --> 00:54:33.516 A:middle
to place click-at-a-glance
views inside the iOS

1067
00:54:33.516 --> 00:54:35.286 A:middle
and OS X Notification Centers.

1068
00:54:35.286 --> 00:54:38.146 A:middle
You can use them for
displaying pretty much any kind

1069
00:54:38.146 --> 00:54:39.296 A:middle
of status information

1070
00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.866 A:middle
or for offering helpful
little utilities to the user.

1071
00:54:42.786 --> 00:54:45.516 A:middle
They're mostly designed to
display short, concise data

1072
00:54:46.186 --> 00:54:48.476 A:middle
but they also allow for
simple user interactions,

1073
00:54:48.846 --> 00:54:50.946 A:middle
and among other things,
they're great launch points

1074
00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:52.346 A:middle
to jump out into full app.

1075
00:54:55.606 --> 00:54:58.986 A:middle
Document Providers extend the
newly designed iCloud Document

1076
00:54:58.986 --> 00:55:02.396 A:middle
Picker and allow you to access
additional storage mechanisms.

1077
00:55:02.726 --> 00:55:04.156 A:middle
For example, in an enterprise

1078
00:55:04.156 --> 00:55:06.276 A:middle
that uses a third-party
Cloud service.

1079
00:55:07.326 --> 00:55:09.346 A:middle
And we offer a similar
mechanism on OS X

1080
00:55:09.346 --> 00:55:12.566 A:middle
and remote file-sharing
services can annotate Finder

1081
00:55:12.696 --> 00:55:13.476 A:middle
with their sync status.

1082
00:55:16.096 --> 00:55:18.656 A:middle
Another very important new
mechanism is the ability

1083
00:55:18.656 --> 00:55:20.306 A:middle
to provide third-party
keyboards.

1084
00:55:20.646 --> 00:55:23.796 A:middle
You can use them to support
additional languages or any kind

1085
00:55:23.796 --> 00:55:25.636 A:middle
of input methods that
you might think about.

1086
00:55:27.636 --> 00:55:30.166 A:middle
Creating extensions is as
simple as creating apps.

1087
00:55:30.796 --> 00:55:33.146 A:middle
The extended export with all
the things you might need,

1088
00:55:33.576 --> 00:55:36.756 A:middle
such as new templates,
additional scheme settings

1089
00:55:36.756 --> 00:55:37.816 A:middle
so that you can launch the apps

1090
00:55:37.816 --> 00:55:39.576 A:middle
that actually host
your extensions.

1091
00:55:40.486 --> 00:55:43.156 A:middle
We improved our XPC service
debugging capabilities,

1092
00:55:43.366 --> 00:55:46.526 A:middle
and we even added
additional simulators for some

1093
00:55:46.526 --> 00:55:47.396 A:middle
of the extension points.

1094
00:55:50.096 --> 00:55:52.396 A:middle
So, extensions are a very
powerful new mechanism

1095
00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:54.576 A:middle
to customize our
operating systems,

1096
00:55:54.916 --> 00:55:56.226 A:middle
and we think they're
going to be very,

1097
00:55:56.226 --> 00:55:57.686 A:middle
very popular with our users.

1098
00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:02.566 A:middle
Next, we're going to talk
about new APIs in iOS 8,

1099
00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:04.796 A:middle
and for that I'm going
to hand over to Toby.

[ Applause ]

1101
00:56:09.306 --> 00:56:09.786 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Andreas.

1102
00:56:11.976 --> 00:56:12.586 A:middle
Good morning.

1103
00:56:14.716 --> 00:56:15.816 A:middle
Well, as you heard this morning,

1104
00:56:15.816 --> 00:56:17.826 A:middle
we've got a pretty big
release for you this year.

1105
00:56:18.886 --> 00:56:23.096 A:middle
In fact, this is almost as large
as the original iPhone SDK.

1106
00:56:23.096 --> 00:56:27.086 A:middle
Now, we took a focus, we
took a very focused approach

1107
00:56:27.086 --> 00:56:27.906 A:middle
to this release.

1108
00:56:28.856 --> 00:56:31.286 A:middle
The major theme this
year is integration.

1109
00:56:32.076 --> 00:56:33.536 A:middle
Integration with the OS.

1110
00:56:33.796 --> 00:56:37.256 A:middle
Andreas just told you how your
apps can plug into the system

1111
00:56:37.506 --> 00:56:39.106 A:middle
and even other applications.

1112
00:56:40.176 --> 00:56:43.216 A:middle
We're integrating across our
devices with our new Cloud

1113
00:56:43.216 --> 00:56:47.056 A:middle
of Continuity features and we're
providing deeper integration

1114
00:56:47.056 --> 00:56:49.666 A:middle
with the hardware and even
with the world around.

1115
00:56:51.906 --> 00:56:53.396 A:middle
Let's start by taking
a look at two

1116
00:56:53.396 --> 00:56:55.256 A:middle
of our more popular
applications.

1117
00:56:56.086 --> 00:56:59.306 A:middle
Underlying each of these
is a very rich set of API.

1118
00:57:01.066 --> 00:57:03.446 A:middle
We've introduced a new
Photos framework this year

1119
00:57:03.446 --> 00:57:06.126 A:middle
and have greatly
enhanced the media API

1120
00:57:06.406 --> 00:57:08.266 A:middle
with many long-standing
requests.

1121
00:57:09.336 --> 00:57:11.276 A:middle
Combined, they form
the foundation

1122
00:57:11.276 --> 00:57:14.656 A:middle
of a photographic platform
that brings your applications

1123
00:57:14.656 --> 00:57:16.356 A:middle
in right alongside our own.

1124
00:57:18.826 --> 00:57:21.666 A:middle
The new Photos framework
gives you direct access

1125
00:57:21.666 --> 00:57:25.146 A:middle
to the user's photo library
with no need to import a copy

1126
00:57:25.146 --> 00:57:28.996 A:middle
of anything anymore, and you
can even make changes directly

1127
00:57:28.996 --> 00:57:30.366 A:middle
with the appropriate permission.

1128
00:57:31.186 --> 00:57:32.906 A:middle
And with iCloud Photo Library,

1129
00:57:33.236 --> 00:57:36.866 A:middle
you can access the user's entire
collection of photos and movies

1130
00:57:37.166 --> 00:57:39.566 A:middle
without having to worry
about whether they're local

1131
00:57:39.616 --> 00:57:40.766 A:middle
or stored in the Cloud.

1132
00:57:40.896 --> 00:57:42.246 A:middle
We take care of that for you.

1133
00:57:44.366 --> 00:57:47.476 A:middle
The new Camera API gives
you full manual control

1134
00:57:47.476 --> 00:57:50.446 A:middle
over the camera settings, which
I think is something that many

1135
00:57:50.446 --> 00:57:51.856 A:middle
of you have wanted for a while.

1136
00:57:53.406 --> 00:57:56.226 A:middle
You can set the, the
lens position explicitly.

1137
00:57:56.226 --> 00:57:59.046 A:middle
The white balance
or color temperature

1138
00:57:59.486 --> 00:58:03.026 A:middle
and various exposure settings,
like the shutter speed and ISO.

1139
00:58:03.026 --> 00:58:07.136 A:middle
And these are all the same APIs
that our applications are using.

1140
00:58:08.956 --> 00:58:12.446 A:middle
A great new feature lets you
grab a burst of photographs,

1141
00:58:12.476 --> 00:58:14.506 A:middle
each with different
exposure settings,

1142
00:58:15.596 --> 00:58:16.906 A:middle
and with the video tool box,

1143
00:58:16.906 --> 00:58:20.096 A:middle
you can now access the
hardware H264 encoder

1144
00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.336 A:middle
and decoder directly.

1145
00:58:23.046 --> 00:58:23.816 A:middle
[Background applause]
Yes, thank you.

1146
00:58:27.146 --> 00:58:28.096 A:middle
Now, we announced a number

1147
00:58:28.096 --> 00:58:30.336 A:middle
of great new initiatives
this morning, and we're going

1148
00:58:30.336 --> 00:58:32.476 A:middle
to cover them all in
great detail this week.

1149
00:58:32.796 --> 00:58:34.836 A:middle
I want to touch on
just a few of them now.

1150
00:58:36.396 --> 00:58:38.366 A:middle
First, Local Authentication.

1151
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:40.666 A:middle
This lets you ask the user

1152
00:58:40.666 --> 00:58:44.346 A:middle
to authenticate using touch
ID right in your application.

1153
00:58:45.196 --> 00:58:46.416 A:middle
It's a very simple API,

1154
00:58:46.416 --> 00:58:49.826 A:middle
and we tell you whether the
authentication succeeded or not.

1155
00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:52.126 A:middle
At no time, though,
do you get access

1156
00:58:52.126 --> 00:58:54.046 A:middle
to the user's biometric
information.

1157
00:58:54.596 --> 00:58:55.926 A:middle
That's stored away securely

1158
00:58:55.926 --> 00:58:58.606 A:middle
so that not even our own
applications can get access

1159
00:58:59.726 --> 00:59:00.666 A:middle
to that.

1160
00:59:01.376 --> 00:59:04.976 A:middle
Handoff lets you start a task
on one device and pick it

1161
00:59:04.976 --> 00:59:08.416 A:middle
up seamlessly on another
Mac, phone or, or iPad.

1162
00:59:09.496 --> 00:59:13.806 A:middle
You create an NSUserActivity
to encapsulate an activity

1163
00:59:13.806 --> 00:59:15.986 A:middle
in your app such as
opening a web page,

1164
00:59:16.446 --> 00:59:19.656 A:middle
and then as the context changes,
you update that activity.

1165
00:59:19.986 --> 00:59:23.246 A:middle
And note that this contains only
the metadata for the activity

1166
00:59:23.306 --> 00:59:25.986 A:middle
such as the document
URL or scroll position.

1167
00:59:26.426 --> 00:59:28.026 A:middle
You need to find
an alternate means

1168
00:59:28.236 --> 00:59:31.066 A:middle
for getting the actual data
across to the other devices.

1169
00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:35.346 A:middle
Now, once you've created this
activity, we'll take care

1170
00:59:35.346 --> 00:59:37.746 A:middle
of advertising it across
all of your devices.

1171
00:59:38.396 --> 00:59:39.796 A:middle
We're going to tell
only the devices

1172
00:59:39.796 --> 00:59:42.136 A:middle
which are actually near you,
so you don't need to worry

1173
00:59:42.136 --> 00:59:43.866 A:middle
about your computer
at home revealing

1174
00:59:43.866 --> 00:59:45.256 A:middle
when you're surfing
the web at work.

1175
00:59:48.456 --> 00:59:51.626 A:middle
Health and wellness has become
extremely popular lately,

1176
00:59:52.116 --> 00:59:54.546 A:middle
with new applications
and devices exploding

1177
00:59:54.546 --> 00:59:55.856 A:middle
on the scene every day.

1178
00:59:56.776 --> 00:59:58.526 A:middle
HealthKit provides a platform

1179
00:59:58.836 --> 01:00:00.746 A:middle
where your applications
can store

1180
01:00:00.746 --> 01:00:02.976 A:middle
and share health-related
information.

1181
01:00:03.846 --> 01:00:06.266 A:middle
We can import some kinds
of data automatically

1182
01:00:06.266 --> 01:00:09.256 A:middle
from standard supporting devices
such as your blood pressure

1183
01:00:09.256 --> 01:00:12.446 A:middle
and glucose levels, and
your app can read and write

1184
01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:14.836 A:middle
over 60 different
kinds of information,

1185
01:00:15.266 --> 01:00:17.226 A:middle
ranging from fitness
to nutrition

1186
01:00:17.526 --> 01:00:18.756 A:middle
to medical information.

1187
01:00:19.696 --> 01:00:22.216 A:middle
Now, all of this is extremely
sensitive, of course,

1188
01:00:22.446 --> 01:00:25.376 A:middle
and so we give the user
extremely fine-grained control

1189
01:00:25.376 --> 01:00:26.876 A:middle
over who can access what.

1190
01:00:26.876 --> 01:00:31.846 A:middle
Now, I'd like to talk
about design a little bit.

1191
01:00:33.436 --> 01:00:37.176 A:middle
Last year, of course, well, we
completely revamped the iOS UI

1192
01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:40.806 A:middle
and I told you at the time that
we were only just beginning.

1193
01:00:41.566 --> 01:00:42.796 A:middle
Now, that wasn't a threat.

1194
01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:45.676 A:middle
We've continued to add
refinements, but just not

1195
01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:50.376 A:middle
at quite the same breakneck
pace as we have before.

1196
01:00:51.276 --> 01:00:54.306 A:middle
Interactive notifications
let you provide the user

1197
01:00:54.306 --> 01:00:58.296 A:middle
with custom actions right there
in the notification banner.

1198
01:00:59.046 --> 01:01:00.266 A:middle
And as you heard this morning,

1199
01:01:00.676 --> 01:01:02.986 A:middle
they even work on
the lock screen.

1200
01:01:03.856 --> 01:01:08.526 A:middle
Now, because your users want
to focus on their content

1201
01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:12.146 A:middle
and not the chrome
around it, in landscape,

1202
01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:15.626 A:middle
we're automatically hiding
the status bar and shrinking,

1203
01:01:15.626 --> 01:01:18.486 A:middle
or hiding, the navigation
bar and tool bars.

1204
01:01:20.066 --> 01:01:24.056 A:middle
And we have a new compact style
for action sheets in landscape.

1205
01:01:26.546 --> 01:01:28.016 A:middle
We're continuing to push support

1206
01:01:28.016 --> 01:01:31.176 A:middle
for dynamic type throughout
our own applications,

1207
01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:34.256 A:middle
and we've greatly enhanced
the API in UIKit and WebKit

1208
01:01:34.256 --> 01:01:37.086 A:middle
to make it even easier
for you to adopt.

1209
01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.526 A:middle
And finally, we have
a new settings pane,

1210
01:01:41.526 --> 01:01:44.526 A:middle
which combines your applications
preferences with all

1211
01:01:44.526 --> 01:01:46.796 A:middle
of the various system
privacy preferences

1212
01:01:46.796 --> 01:01:48.436 A:middle
such as whether the user wants

1213
01:01:48.436 --> 01:01:50.336 A:middle
to receive notifications
from your app.

1214
01:01:51.376 --> 01:01:53.706 A:middle
We've put them together
in one place here now

1215
01:01:53.946 --> 01:01:55.336 A:middle
and given you a simple API

1216
01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:57.296 A:middle
so that you can take
the user right here

1217
01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:58.876 A:middle
from within your application.

1218
01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:07.006 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1219
01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:10.446 A:middle
Now I read this quote on
John August's blog a couple

1220
01:02:10.446 --> 01:02:11.126 A:middle
of months ago.

1221
01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:15.046 A:middle
"Adding landscape to the
iPhone isn't impossible,

1222
01:02:15.666 --> 01:02:17.566 A:middle
but it means not
doing something else,

1223
01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:20.936 A:middle
and right now the many
'something elses' are worth a

1224
01:02:20.936 --> 01:02:21.606 A:middle
lot more."

1225
01:02:22.846 --> 01:02:24.376 A:middle
That really resonated with me

1226
01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:27.236 A:middle
because we've been spending
a lot time thinking about how

1227
01:02:27.236 --> 01:02:30.276 A:middle
to manage the proliferation
of UI layouts.

1228
01:02:32.366 --> 01:02:35.846 A:middle
When we launched iPhone seven
years ago, it was pretty simple.

1229
01:02:36.846 --> 01:02:40.876 A:middle
You had one screen size and
two user-interface orientations

1230
01:02:40.926 --> 01:02:41.506 A:middle
to deal with.

1231
01:02:42.716 --> 01:02:46.116 A:middle
A few years later, we
added iPad and now you have

1232
01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:48.546 A:middle
to use a global user
interface idiom to select

1233
01:02:48.546 --> 01:02:51.466 A:middle
between your iPhone
and your iPad layouts.

1234
01:02:52.566 --> 01:02:55.656 A:middle
Then we added iPhone 5 with
its larger screen size,

1235
01:02:55.656 --> 01:02:57.856 A:middle
and now you've got a
total of six screen bounds

1236
01:02:57.856 --> 01:02:58.916 A:middle
to have to contend with.

1237
01:02:59.356 --> 01:03:01.346 A:middle
And that's getting
to be rather a lot.

1238
01:03:01.346 --> 01:03:04.626 A:middle
And so we've been working to try
and rationalize things for you.

1239
01:03:05.366 --> 01:03:10.356 A:middle
Now, in iOS 8, you can
use a single storyboard

1240
01:03:10.896 --> 01:03:16.306 A:middle
across iPhone 4, iPhone
5, portrait and landscape,

1241
01:03:16.766 --> 01:03:20.766 A:middle
and here's where things get
interesting, on the iPad 2.

1242
01:03:21.866 --> 01:03:23.166 A:middle
Now, hang on a second.

1243
01:03:23.816 --> 01:03:26.686 A:middle
We've always encouraged
you to design explicitly

1244
01:03:26.726 --> 01:03:30.286 A:middle
for iPad's larger screen
size and not just blow

1245
01:03:30.286 --> 01:03:33.366 A:middle
up your iPhone UI, and
we're not backpedaling

1246
01:03:33.406 --> 01:03:34.536 A:middle
on this message now.

1247
01:03:36.406 --> 01:03:39.786 A:middle
Different screen sizes demand
a different user experience,

1248
01:03:40.236 --> 01:03:42.186 A:middle
and so we've been
teaching storyboards

1249
01:03:42.236 --> 01:03:44.946 A:middle
and our view controllers
how to adapt themselves

1250
01:03:45.096 --> 01:03:46.516 A:middle
to the environment
that they're in.

1251
01:03:47.826 --> 01:03:49.186 A:middle
In this example here,

1252
01:03:49.546 --> 01:03:52.226 A:middle
it's actually the same
split-view controller class

1253
01:03:52.366 --> 01:03:54.816 A:middle
running on both the
iPhone and the iPad.

1254
01:03:55.616 --> 01:03:57.586 A:middle
On the phone, well
it looks and behaves

1255
01:03:57.586 --> 01:04:01.256 A:middle
like a single-column navigation
browser, and on the iPad,

1256
01:04:01.636 --> 01:04:03.876 A:middle
you get the split-paned
master detail view

1257
01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:06.446 A:middle
that you're probably
pretty familiar with.

1258
01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:11.756 A:middle
We're introducing a new notion
called size classes to try

1259
01:04:11.756 --> 01:04:14.446 A:middle
and express this idea
of how big something is.

1260
01:04:15.776 --> 01:04:19.096 A:middle
Broadly speaking, you can
think of the iPhone size UI

1261
01:04:19.206 --> 01:04:24.036 A:middle
as a compact size class and the
iPad UI as a regular size class.

1262
01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:26.166 A:middle
But don't make the
mistake of thinking

1263
01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:29.106 A:middle
that size classes are bound
to a particular device.

1264
01:04:29.526 --> 01:04:30.976 A:middle
They're a lot more
general than that.

1265
01:04:32.596 --> 01:04:35.326 A:middle
For example, in this
split-view controller on iPad,

1266
01:04:35.716 --> 01:04:37.586 A:middle
it has two child-view
controllers.

1267
01:04:38.586 --> 01:04:40.766 A:middle
The one on the left here,
well, it kind of looks

1268
01:04:40.766 --> 01:04:42.506 A:middle
like an iPhone UI, and in fact,

1269
01:04:42.506 --> 01:04:45.766 A:middle
it has a compact size
class whereas the one

1270
01:04:45.766 --> 01:04:48.186 A:middle
on the right has a
regular size class.

1271
01:04:50.066 --> 01:04:52.956 A:middle
This idea of things adapting
themselves to the space

1272
01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:56.066 A:middle
that they're contained in
forms the basis for something

1273
01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:57.646 A:middle
that we're calling adaptive UI,

1274
01:04:58.306 --> 01:05:00.176 A:middle
and this is what makes
it possible for you

1275
01:05:00.176 --> 01:05:02.926 A:middle
to use a single storyboard
on iPhone 4,

1276
01:05:03.346 --> 01:05:05.166 A:middle
iPhone 5, and the iPad.

1277
01:05:06.726 --> 01:05:08.626 A:middle
Now, I'd like to ask
Max Drukman to come up

1278
01:05:08.626 --> 01:05:11.596 A:middle
and give you a quick tour of
how easy this is to do in Xcode.

1279
01:05:12.046 --> 01:05:12.346 A:middle
Max?

&gt;&gt; I missed you guys.

1282
01:05:21.176 --> 01:05:22.046 A:middle
Especially you, Craig.

1283
01:05:23.676 --> 01:05:28.886 A:middle
All right, I'm going to show
you how size classes in iOS 8,

1284
01:05:29.306 --> 01:05:30.716 A:middle
if I can get the
right screen up,

1285
01:05:31.416 --> 01:05:34.966 A:middle
allow me to create a single
storyboard that is adaptive

1286
01:05:35.406 --> 01:05:39.176 A:middle
for both iPhone and iPad.

1287
01:05:39.426 --> 01:05:42.006 A:middle
Here's my party finder
app, NO.SLEEP.

1288
01:05:42.006 --> 01:05:45.686 A:middle
@DUBDUB. It's a pretty
simple little thing.

1289
01:05:45.686 --> 01:05:47.896 A:middle
There's a login screen
on the left and a,

1290
01:05:47.896 --> 01:05:49.446 A:middle
a list of parties on the right.

1291
01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:55.516 A:middle
Now, the astute among you may
notice that my layout is square.

1292
01:05:56.296 --> 01:05:56.976 A:middle
Why is that?

1293
01:05:57.706 --> 01:06:05.056 A:middle
Well, because size
classes are, they're, wow!

1294
01:06:05.846 --> 01:06:09.186 A:middle
Since size classes
aren't, they're not real,

1295
01:06:10.056 --> 01:06:12.556 A:middle
one size class doesn't
necessarily map

1296
01:06:12.756 --> 01:06:14.746 A:middle
to one device and
one orientation.

1297
01:06:15.546 --> 01:06:18.596 A:middle
The layout canvas in,

1298
01:06:19.526 --> 01:06:23.836 A:middle
in interface builder
is also that way.

1299
01:06:24.946 --> 01:06:26.396 A:middle
Wow. Could've done that better.

1300
01:06:29.156 --> 01:06:33.776 A:middle
Now, just because I'm, so,

1301
01:06:33.976 --> 01:06:35.946 A:middle
I'm laying out my
interface this way.

1302
01:06:35.946 --> 01:06:40.066 A:middle
I still want to see how
it looks on real devices

1303
01:06:40.226 --> 01:06:41.506 A:middle
when it gets in peoples' hands.

1304
01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:46.026 A:middle
For that, I have the
preview assistant.

1305
01:06:47.866 --> 01:06:50.716 A:middle
In Xcode 6, the preview
assistant allows me

1306
01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:53.816 A:middle
to add multiple devices
and orientations

1307
01:06:54.356 --> 01:06:59.366 A:middle
so I can see how my interface is
working in as many devices and,

1308
01:06:59.476 --> 01:07:00.736 A:middle
and layouts as I want.

1309
01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:05.906 A:middle
And here you can see that I've
already specialized for one

1310
01:07:05.906 --> 01:07:09.706 A:middle
of the size classes so that
my interface looks different

1311
01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:13.126 A:middle
on an iPhone in landscape
orientation.

1312
01:07:13.706 --> 01:07:18.536 A:middle
Now, if I select my
other view controller,

1313
01:07:19.756 --> 01:07:21.166 A:middle
we can see my party table

1314
01:07:22.256 --> 01:07:24.486 A:middle
and this I haven't
specialized at all.

1315
01:07:25.426 --> 01:07:28.136 A:middle
That's because table
views, like many views,

1316
01:07:28.506 --> 01:07:30.176 A:middle
are themselves adaptive,

1317
01:07:30.576 --> 01:07:33.316 A:middle
and so there's no specialization
that's necessary at all.

1318
01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:38.916 A:middle
Well, let's go back
to my login screen.

1319
01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:44.476 A:middle
Now, Interface Builder starts
you out in the size class

1320
01:07:44.476 --> 01:07:47.236 A:middle
for any width and any height.

1321
01:07:48.386 --> 01:07:52.166 A:middle
So this is where you lay out
what is common about your app

1322
01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:53.906 A:middle
across all size classes.

1323
01:07:54.776 --> 01:07:56.276 A:middle
It's a great place to do edits

1324
01:07:56.276 --> 01:07:57.866 A:middle
that you want reflected
everywhere.

1325
01:07:58.736 --> 01:08:01.606 A:middle
For instance, if I want to
move this shiny little graphic

1326
01:08:01.606 --> 01:08:05.296 A:middle
up into the corner,
that will get reflected

1327
01:08:05.296 --> 01:08:07.676 A:middle
in both landscape and portrait.

1328
01:08:08.696 --> 01:08:12.126 A:middle
But because one size
class does not fit all,

1329
01:08:12.906 --> 01:08:16.756 A:middle
I can also tell Interface
Builder to edit

1330
01:08:16.935 --> 01:08:18.276 A:middle
in different size classes.

1331
01:08:19.736 --> 01:08:22.466 A:middle
In this case, I'm going
to choose compact height,

1332
01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.986 A:middle
which is the size class
that maps to an iPhone

1333
01:08:27.046 --> 01:08:28.296 A:middle
in landscape orientation.

1334
01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:31.696 A:middle
And now, when I make an edit,

1335
01:08:31.696 --> 01:08:34.366 A:middle
for instance moving
all these objects up,

1336
01:08:35.636 --> 01:08:39.265 A:middle
that will only be reflected
in a landscape orientation.

1337
01:08:39.906 --> 01:08:48.725 A:middle
Now, if I add an iPad to the
mix, we can see yet another take

1338
01:08:49.066 --> 01:08:51.576 A:middle
at positioning and sizing
these same elements.

1339
01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:54.966 A:middle
And once again, these
are all the same elements

1340
01:08:55.326 --> 01:08:58.765 A:middle
with the same logic, styles,
connections still attached.

1341
01:08:59.326 --> 01:09:01.636 A:middle
They're just positioned
and sized differently

1342
01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:03.716 A:middle
because they have
different constraints.

1343
01:09:05.446 --> 01:09:07.946 A:middle
So, if I were to change
the nature of something,

1344
01:09:08.486 --> 01:09:13.026 A:middle
like the background image
here, that will get reflected

1345
01:09:13.826 --> 01:09:16.506 A:middle
in all of the size classes.

1346
01:09:19.076 --> 01:09:22.305 A:middle
That's a quick take at
size classes in iOS 8

1347
01:09:22.645 --> 01:09:25.345 A:middle
and one storyboard
to rule them all.

1348
01:09:26.666 --> 01:09:27.426 A:middle
Back to you, Toby.

1350

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Max.

1351
01:09:36.055 --> 01:09:38.356 A:middle
Well, so that's just a taste of
some of the things that we have

1352
01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:41.886 A:middle
for you in iOS 8, and we can't
wait for you to get your hands

1353
01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:43.326 A:middle
on it and start playing with it.

1354
01:09:44.616 --> 01:09:46.256 A:middle
Now, I'd like to
talk about iCloud.

1355
01:09:47.426 --> 01:09:50.116 A:middle
iCloud is an important
and thriving part

1356
01:09:50.116 --> 01:09:51.826 A:middle
of the Apple ecosystem.

1357
01:09:53.036 --> 01:09:56.746 A:middle
We have well over 400 million
users, and we're continuing

1358
01:09:56.746 --> 01:09:59.886 A:middle
to improve and add new
features to it all the time.

1359
01:10:01.466 --> 01:10:03.596 A:middle
First, let's talk
about iCloud Drive.

1360
01:10:05.686 --> 01:10:08.276 A:middle
So, we introduced documents
in the cloud a few years ago,

1361
01:10:08.276 --> 01:10:11.976 A:middle
of course, and it provides a
seamless, in-app experience

1362
01:10:11.976 --> 01:10:14.756 A:middle
to getting your files from
device, device, to the Mac.

1363
01:10:15.346 --> 01:10:17.206 A:middle
And that's great, if you happen

1364
01:10:17.206 --> 01:10:20.246 A:middle
to have the same application
running on your phone,

1365
01:10:20.246 --> 01:10:23.716 A:middle
your iPad, and your Mac, but
that's not always the case.

1366
01:10:25.926 --> 01:10:28.966 A:middle
iCloud Drive gives you a
folder right there in Finder,

1367
01:10:29.226 --> 01:10:31.236 A:middle
where you can manage
your files directly.

1368
01:10:31.926 --> 01:10:34.756 A:middle
And we're even making
this available

1369
01:10:34.756 --> 01:10:36.716 A:middle
on Windows too, in the Explorer.

1370
01:10:37.786 --> 01:10:39.966 A:middle
Now, if you're already
a document-based app,

1371
01:10:40.286 --> 01:10:41.926 A:middle
it's actually pretty
easy for you

1372
01:10:41.926 --> 01:10:43.806 A:middle
to add support for iCloud Drive.

1373
01:10:44.646 --> 01:10:47.886 A:middle
On the Mac, well, you get it
basically for free with AppKit.

1374
01:10:48.936 --> 01:10:51.906 A:middle
On iOS, however, you
can't access the files

1375
01:10:51.906 --> 01:10:56.366 A:middle
in iCloud Drive directly without
some form of user intervention.

1376
01:10:58.286 --> 01:11:01.486 A:middle
Well, that's done in this
new UIDocumentPicker class,

1377
01:11:01.576 --> 01:11:04.466 A:middle
which lets the user select
the files that they want

1378
01:11:04.466 --> 01:11:05.956 A:middle
to use in your application.

1379
01:11:06.866 --> 01:11:09.986 A:middle
We then dynamically extend
your application sandbox

1380
01:11:09.986 --> 01:11:12.746 A:middle
around those files
so that you can read

1381
01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:14.186 A:middle
and write them directly,
without having

1382
01:11:14.186 --> 01:11:15.916 A:middle
to make a copy of
anything anymore.

1383
01:11:16.876 --> 01:11:19.876 A:middle
And this even works across
different application containers

1384
01:11:20.256 --> 01:11:23.076 A:middle
so that multiple cooperating
applications can all work

1385
01:11:23.076 --> 01:11:25.016 A:middle
together on the same files.

1386
01:11:26.936 --> 01:11:30.956 A:middle
We told you earlier how document
providers let you extend your

1387
01:11:30.956 --> 01:11:33.486 A:middle
device with alternate
file storage systems,

1388
01:11:33.906 --> 01:11:36.466 A:middle
and these are all managed
by the UIDocumentPicker.

1389
01:11:36.786 --> 01:11:39.356 A:middle
And so once you're adopting
that, there's nothing else

1390
01:11:39.356 --> 01:11:42.486 A:middle
for you to have to do in your
application to take advantage

1391
01:11:42.486 --> 01:11:43.906 A:middle
of these document providers.

1392
01:11:44.626 --> 01:11:45.806 A:middle
And that's iCloud Drive.

1393
01:11:45.866 --> 01:11:46.876 A:middle
We think it's pretty easy.

1394
01:11:48.786 --> 01:11:50.956 A:middle
Now, I'm really excited
to be able

1395
01:11:50.956 --> 01:11:52.566 A:middle
to tell you a bit
about CloudKit.

1396
01:11:53.486 --> 01:11:57.666 A:middle
Simply put, CloudKit lets you
write client server applications

1397
01:11:58.076 --> 01:11:59.856 A:middle
without having to
write the server part.

1398
01:12:00.906 --> 01:12:02.386 A:middle
Let's say you've got a hot idea

1399
01:12:02.386 --> 01:12:05.276 A:middle
for a coffee shop review
service or, I don't know,

1400
01:12:05.276 --> 01:12:06.546 A:middle
a photo sharing service.

1401
01:12:07.696 --> 01:12:10.856 A:middle
Well, here's what you don't
have to do with CloudKit.

1402
01:12:13.206 --> 01:12:16.556 A:middle
You don't have to write any
server code, you don't have

1403
01:12:16.556 --> 01:12:20.536 A:middle
to operate a 24-by-7
service, and you don't have

1404
01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:21.726 A:middle
to deploy any servers.

1405
01:12:22.876 --> 01:12:25.296 A:middle
And in fact, once you
become wildly successful,

1406
01:12:26.226 --> 01:12:28.116 A:middle
here's something else
that you don't have to do.

1407
01:12:30.026 --> 01:12:30.306 A:middle

All you need to do to build
a client server application

1410
01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:44.286 A:middle
with CloudKit is write your iOS
and Mac app, and we take care

1411
01:12:44.286 --> 01:12:45.726 A:middle
of all of the rest
of it for you.

1412
01:12:47.236 --> 01:12:48.966 A:middle
So, when we were
designing CloudKit,

1413
01:12:49.406 --> 01:12:52.776 A:middle
we asked ourselves the question,
"What do you need in the cloud

1414
01:12:53.016 --> 01:12:54.376 A:middle
to be able to all of this?"

1415
01:12:55.966 --> 01:12:58.306 A:middle
Well, a database seems
like a good place to start.

1416
01:12:58.876 --> 01:13:01.786 A:middle
We've got records and
relationships, queries,

1417
01:13:01.786 --> 01:13:03.306 A:middle
all the things you
come to expect

1418
01:13:03.306 --> 01:13:04.716 A:middle
from an OS-equal database.

1419
01:13:05.956 --> 01:13:08.406 A:middle
We have an asset API
to efficiently store

1420
01:13:08.406 --> 01:13:10.656 A:middle
and retrieve large
blobs of data.

1421
01:13:10.656 --> 01:13:13.446 A:middle
And we have a subscription
service.

1422
01:13:14.406 --> 01:13:17.336 A:middle
You can think of the
subscription service as kind

1423
01:13:17.336 --> 01:13:20.156 A:middle
of like a long-running
query on the server,

1424
01:13:20.566 --> 01:13:23.946 A:middle
and as new records are matched
by the query, iCloud will send

1425
01:13:23.946 --> 01:13:26.406 A:middle
out push notifications
to all of the devices

1426
01:13:26.406 --> 01:13:28.716 A:middle
that have registered an
interest in that subscription.

1427
01:13:30.196 --> 01:13:33.446 A:middle
We've built a developer
portal so that you can go

1428
01:13:33.446 --> 01:13:35.306 A:middle
and take a look exactly
at what's going

1429
01:13:35.306 --> 01:13:37.116 A:middle
on with your service
in the Cloud.

1430
01:13:38.466 --> 01:13:41.016 A:middle
And of course, you're
going to want users.

1431
01:13:42.216 --> 01:13:45.136 A:middle
Well, it turns out, we've got
rather a lot of them in iCloud,

1432
01:13:45.596 --> 01:13:49.456 A:middle
and every single one of those
iCloud users could be your user

1433
01:13:49.456 --> 01:13:50.056 A:middle
as well.

1434
01:13:50.146 --> 01:13:53.516 A:middle
There's no account to create, no
signup, or any hoops they have

1435
01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:56.296 A:middle
to jump through, and we think
that's pretty huge for you.

[ Applause ]

1437
01:14:03.696 --> 01:14:06.796 A:middle
As Craig told you this
morning, it's basically free

1438
01:14:07.406 --> 01:14:08.916 A:middle
up to these maximum limits.

1439
01:14:09.726 --> 01:14:12.556 A:middle
Now, that's one petabyte
of asset data.

1440
01:14:13.456 --> 01:14:14.866 A:middle
To put this in perspective,

1441
01:14:15.136 --> 01:14:17.486 A:middle
let's say that you're building
a photo sharing service

1442
01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:19.426 A:middle
and you're using the
same image size as some

1443
01:14:19.426 --> 01:14:20.966 A:middle
of your popular competitors.

1444
01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:25.326 A:middle
That would let you
store 10 billion photos

1445
01:14:25.466 --> 01:14:27.286 A:middle
in iCloud for free.

1446
01:14:27.286 --> 01:14:30.636 A:middle
And we think that's
pretty huge too.

1447
01:14:31.576 --> 01:14:35.126 A:middle
We're doubling down on
this technology ourselves.

1448
01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:39.206 A:middle
iCloud Photo Library and iCloud
Drive are both built on top

1449
01:14:39.206 --> 01:14:42.186 A:middle
of CloudKit and we see
this as the foundation

1450
01:14:42.236 --> 01:14:43.896 A:middle
for our services moving forward.

1451
01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:47.986 A:middle
We think this is really cool,
and we've been working on it

1452
01:14:47.986 --> 01:14:50.396 A:middle
for a while and can't wait
to see what you do with this.

1453
01:14:51.056 --> 01:14:53.076 A:middle
We think this is going to
open up a whole new class

1454
01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:54.236 A:middle
of application for you.

1455
01:14:55.066 --> 01:14:58.256 A:middle
And that's what we
have for iCloud.

1456
01:14:59.186 --> 01:15:01.116 A:middle
Now, I'd like to turn
it over to Andreas

1457
01:15:01.116 --> 01:15:02.806 A:middle

1460
01:15:11.646 --> 01:15:11.976 A:middle
&gt;&gt; All right.

1461
01:15:11.976 --> 01:15:13.276 A:middle
Let's talk about OS X.

1462
01:15:14.996 --> 01:15:18.586 A:middle
Yosemite is a big new
release with an all-new look.

1463
01:15:19.096 --> 01:15:22.426 A:middle
We carefully evolved this look
from our previous releases

1464
01:15:22.426 --> 01:15:25.406 A:middle
to make it truly beautiful
without being disruptive.

1465
01:15:26.906 --> 01:15:29.076 A:middle
The basic ideas behind
the redesign were

1466
01:15:29.076 --> 01:15:32.876 A:middle
to increase consistency, to
reduce visual noise and clutter,

1467
01:15:33.716 --> 01:15:37.106 A:middle
to make animations more subtle,
and increase the vibrancy

1468
01:15:37.106 --> 01:15:38.816 A:middle
of the UI for more liveliness.

1469
01:15:39.976 --> 01:15:41.796 A:middle
Let's go over the
cornerstones of the new look

1470
01:15:41.846 --> 01:15:43.506 A:middle
and what they mean
to app developers.

1471
01:15:45.196 --> 01:15:47.896 A:middle
We started by completely
redesigning our window chrome.

1472
01:15:47.896 --> 01:15:51.526 A:middle
We made our toolbars and
our title bars simpler

1473
01:15:51.636 --> 01:15:52.246 A:middle
and more compact.

1474
01:15:53.946 --> 01:15:56.536 A:middle
But for non-document-based apps,
we went a whole lot further

1475
01:15:56.536 --> 01:15:58.396 A:middle
and defined a new
style of window chrome.

1476
01:15:59.396 --> 01:16:02.046 A:middle
Many of our apps now
use a combined toolbar

1477
01:16:02.196 --> 01:16:04.286 A:middle
in which we merge the
title bar and the toolbar

1478
01:16:04.566 --> 01:16:06.036 A:middle
into a single, compact row.

1479
01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:09.086 A:middle
This is a great way to
give users more space

1480
01:16:09.086 --> 01:16:11.506 A:middle
for their content,
but it only works well

1481
01:16:11.506 --> 01:16:14.416 A:middle
if you have few enough toolbar
items to leave enough space

1482
01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:16.826 A:middle
so that the user can grab
the window and drag it

1483
01:16:16.826 --> 01:16:19.706 A:middle
around on the screen, so this
is not recommended for all apps.

1484
01:16:21.646 --> 01:16:24.386 A:middle
Now, for several of our apps,
we also moved the search fields,

1485
01:16:24.496 --> 01:16:26.966 A:middle
which have historically been
located at the far right side

1486
01:16:26.996 --> 01:16:29.686 A:middle
of our toolbars, smack into
the middle of the window

1487
01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:32.916 A:middle
if searching is the primary way
of interacting with that app,

1488
01:16:33.466 --> 01:16:36.166 A:middle
such as is the case
in Maps and Safari.

1489
01:16:37.966 --> 01:16:40.996 A:middle
And for sidebar apps, which have
essentially no toolbar items,

1490
01:16:41.306 --> 01:16:42.636 A:middle
we went yet another step further

1491
01:16:42.636 --> 01:16:44.636 A:middle
and used only partial
title bars.

1492
01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:47.816 A:middle
These windows, they have the
normal window controls on top

1493
01:16:47.816 --> 01:16:50.096 A:middle
of the sidebar, but
otherwise they stretch

1494
01:16:50.096 --> 01:16:52.626 A:middle
out the content all the way
to the edges of the window.

1495
01:16:55.366 --> 01:16:57.916 A:middle
Now, one thing that is
interesting about our new UI is

1496
01:16:57.916 --> 01:17:00.796 A:middle
that it uses a number of
new transparent materials.

1497
01:17:01.476 --> 01:17:03.506 A:middle
For example, if you
scrolled some window content

1498
01:17:03.506 --> 01:17:06.356 A:middle
under the title bars, that
content will still show

1499
01:17:06.406 --> 01:17:08.176 A:middle
through in a heavily
blurred way,

1500
01:17:08.426 --> 01:17:10.946 A:middle
giving the user a better
sense for the entire document.

1501
01:17:11.896 --> 01:17:13.936 A:middle
And the new translucent
sidebars still

1502
01:17:13.936 --> 01:17:15.856 A:middle
at the desktop background
shine through,

1503
01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:19.836 A:middle
so that really gives the user a
way to customize the entire look

1504
01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:21.016 A:middle
and feel of the system.

1505
01:17:23.296 --> 01:17:25.946 A:middle
Now, if you're using our
standard AppKit controls,

1506
01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:27.686 A:middle
such as a layer with
scroll view,

1507
01:17:28.066 --> 01:17:30.936 A:middle
your apps will automatically
inherit the right new look,

1508
01:17:31.926 --> 01:17:34.556 A:middle
and for more custom cases,
you're exposing a number

1509
01:17:34.556 --> 01:17:38.586 A:middle
of new APIs that will get you
the same effect that you see

1510
01:17:38.586 --> 01:17:42.116 A:middle
in our, in our system apps.

1511
01:17:42.596 --> 01:17:43.376 A:middle
One thing you should watch

1512
01:17:43.376 --> 01:17:45.666 A:middle
out for is the readability
of your text.

1513
01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:48.826 A:middle
While the new translucent
effects are very beautiful,

1514
01:17:49.376 --> 01:17:52.006 A:middle
they are not a great fit
for primary user content,

1515
01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:53.696 A:middle
so use these effects
selectively.

1516
01:17:56.226 --> 01:17:58.616 A:middle
Now, we've also changed
the system font in our UI.

1517
01:17:58.616 --> 01:18:01.646 A:middle
We changed it from Lucida
Grande to Helvetica Neue,

1518
01:18:02.816 --> 01:18:03.926 A:middle
and that's how you
pronounce that.

1519
01:18:04.516 --> 01:18:12.846 A:middle
[ Laughter ]

1520
01:18:13.346 --> 01:18:16.546 A:middle
So, we hand-tweaked the
metrics of the new system font

1521
01:18:16.546 --> 01:18:19.306 A:middle
so that they are very,
very close to the metrics

1522
01:18:19.306 --> 01:18:22.036 A:middle
of the old Lucida Grande
font, with a result

1523
01:18:22.106 --> 01:18:25.436 A:middle
that strings have almost the
same size and usually fit

1524
01:18:25.436 --> 01:18:28.216 A:middle
in the space that you've
allocated in your UI so far.

1525
01:18:31.016 --> 01:18:33.086 A:middle
Now, to help with
binary compatibility,

1526
01:18:33.676 --> 01:18:36.846 A:middle
AppKit will actually detect,
AppKit controls will detect

1527
01:18:37.286 --> 01:18:38.956 A:middle
if your strings are
being clipped.

1528
01:18:39.546 --> 01:18:40.856 A:middle
And in that case,
they will ever so,

1529
01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:44.086 A:middle
ever so slightly compress
the strings and make them fit

1530
01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:45.236 A:middle
into the available space.

1531
01:18:47.926 --> 01:18:49.216 A:middle
In addition to the system font,

1532
01:18:49.426 --> 01:18:52.566 A:middle
we've also updated
our application icons

1533
01:18:52.616 --> 01:18:54.506 A:middle
and the glyphs used
throughout the system.

1534
01:18:55.406 --> 01:18:57.606 A:middle
We've tried to remove
unnecessary variations,

1535
01:18:57.676 --> 01:19:00.596 A:middle
and we've standardized on three
basic shapes of app icons:

1536
01:19:01.196 --> 01:19:03.326 A:middle
circle, square, and
tilted rectangle.

1537
01:19:04.676 --> 01:19:07.286 A:middle
Our application icons are
now, now more uniform,

1538
01:19:07.706 --> 01:19:08.906 A:middle
they use more vibrant colors,

1539
01:19:09.006 --> 01:19:13.126 A:middle
and they also remove unnecessary
variations and adornments.

1540
01:19:16.356 --> 01:19:18.536 A:middle
Our AppKit controls
now use animations

1541
01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:20.386 A:middle
that are more meaningful,
and in general,

1542
01:19:20.706 --> 01:19:22.486 A:middle
they support a lot
more styles for,

1543
01:19:22.626 --> 01:19:24.206 A:middle
to support the new
appearance settings

1544
01:19:24.206 --> 01:19:26.056 A:middle
in addition to vibrancy
settings.

1545
01:19:26.726 --> 01:19:28.116 A:middle
Specifically for vibrancy,

1546
01:19:28.206 --> 01:19:30.326 A:middle
they push out their
colors a lot more strongly,

1547
01:19:30.456 --> 01:19:32.296 A:middle
which can really
help its readability

1548
01:19:32.466 --> 01:19:33.606 A:middle
on translucent surfaces.

1549
01:19:35.946 --> 01:19:38.356 A:middle
And another big change
that Jeff just mentioned is

1550
01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:41.756 A:middle
that Yosemite strongly
de-emphasizes dashboard widgets

1551
01:19:41.906 --> 01:19:44.326 A:middle
in favor of the new
Notification Center widgets.

1552
01:19:45.336 --> 01:19:47.856 A:middle
While we still fully support
dashboard, we are now moving

1553
01:19:47.856 --> 01:19:50.916 A:middle
over to running native widgets
inside Notification Center,

1554
01:19:51.506 --> 01:19:52.926 A:middle
and if you're a dashboard
developer,

1555
01:19:53.236 --> 01:19:55.606 A:middle
we suggest that you quickly
adopt the new technology,

1556
01:19:55.606 --> 01:19:58.006 A:middle
which we believe will be even
more popular with our users.

1557
01:20:01.786 --> 01:20:03.186 A:middle
I'd also like to take
a moment and talk

1558
01:20:03.186 --> 01:20:05.146 A:middle
about our accessibility APIs.

1559
01:20:05.606 --> 01:20:08.076 A:middle
Accessibility is a topic
we care about deeply,

1560
01:20:09.056 --> 01:20:11.786 A:middle
and along with the new look,
we made it dramatically simpler

1561
01:20:12.106 --> 01:20:14.476 A:middle
to let your applications
work with voiceover

1562
01:20:14.616 --> 01:20:16.686 A:middle
and our other accessibility
technologies.

1563
01:20:17.306 --> 01:20:18.866 A:middle
We took, we took some
lessons we learned on iOS

1564
01:20:19.066 --> 01:20:23.046 A:middle
and created a new API that
requires much less coding.

1565
01:20:23.796 --> 01:20:24.826 A:middle
So, please take some time

1566
01:20:24.826 --> 01:20:26.786 A:middle
and add this important
capability to your apps.

1567
01:20:27.606 --> 01:20:30.356 A:middle
It has never been easier and
it will change people's lives.

1568
01:20:33.356 --> 01:20:35.686 A:middle
So, that was a quick tour
of the new look in Yosemite.

1569
01:20:36.646 --> 01:20:38.576 A:middle
Once we've shipped this
release later this year,

1570
01:20:38.646 --> 01:20:40.776 A:middle
users will expect
that your apps fit

1571
01:20:40.776 --> 01:20:42.506 A:middle
in with the new look
of Yosemite.

1572
01:20:42.866 --> 01:20:44.776 A:middle
So, please take some time
over the next few months

1573
01:20:45.096 --> 01:20:46.706 A:middle
and change the style to fit

1574
01:20:46.706 --> 01:20:48.826 A:middle
in with what we've done
in our system apps.

1575
01:20:50.586 --> 01:20:52.276 A:middle
Next, we're going
to talk about Xcode,

1576
01:20:52.526 --> 01:20:54.016 A:middle
and for that section
I'm going to hand

1577
01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:54.656 A:middle
over to Matthew [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Andreas.

1580
01:21:05.836 --> 01:21:08.826 A:middle
Now, you've already had a sneak
peek into some of the features

1581
01:21:08.826 --> 01:21:12.626 A:middle
of the new Xcode tools for
iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.

1582
01:21:14.016 --> 01:21:14.756 A:middle
Playgrounds.

1583
01:21:15.106 --> 01:21:16.846 A:middle
A powerful and interactive way

1584
01:21:16.846 --> 01:21:19.516 A:middle
to work with, and
play with, Swift.

1585
01:21:21.366 --> 01:21:24.746 A:middle
The new integrated SpriteKit
and SceneKit design tools,

1586
01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:29.266 A:middle
enabling you to design truly
amazing 2D and 3D applications.

1587
01:21:30.856 --> 01:21:33.356 A:middle
And universal storyboards
with size classes.

1588
01:21:33.476 --> 01:21:36.866 A:middle
A great way to conceptualize
and design your applications

1589
01:21:36.936 --> 01:21:38.606 A:middle
for both iPhone and iPad.

1590
01:21:39.786 --> 01:21:43.036 A:middle
Three great new features, and
we are just getting started.

1591
01:21:44.796 --> 01:21:49.066 A:middle
Universal storyboards, size
classes, and autolayout combine

1592
01:21:49.066 --> 01:21:52.866 A:middle
to enable you to design for all
devices using a single interface

1593
01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:54.666 A:middle
document, and we're
bringing this

1594
01:21:54.846 --> 01:21:57.786 A:middle
to another area, Launch Images.

1595
01:21:58.876 --> 01:22:01.896 A:middle
With iOS 8, you can now provide
an Interface Builder document

1596
01:22:02.206 --> 01:22:04.696 A:middle
and, at runtime, have
the OS generate all

1597
01:22:04.696 --> 01:22:06.886 A:middle
of the necessary
Launch Images for you.

[ Applause ]

1599
01:22:14.926 --> 01:22:17.996 A:middle
So now you no longer need to
provide the individual assets

1600
01:22:18.286 --> 01:22:21.816 A:middle
and you can use the same great
design tools for your interfaces

1601
01:22:22.116 --> 01:22:23.416 A:middle
and your launch presentations.

1602
01:22:24.966 --> 01:22:28.366 A:middle
Now, storyboards have been a
great addition to the iOS tools

1603
01:22:28.636 --> 01:22:31.756 A:middle
for development, and we are
extending their use even further

1604
01:22:31.756 --> 01:22:35.646 A:middle
this year by bringing
them to you for OS X.

[ Applause ]

1606
01:22:39.336 --> 01:22:41.896 A:middle
Storyboards work with
the new view controllers

1607
01:22:41.896 --> 01:22:44.416 A:middle
in OS X Yosemite to
make it really easy

1608
01:22:44.416 --> 01:22:46.456 A:middle
to design great Mac
applications.

1609
01:22:47.186 --> 01:22:49.406 A:middle
You can design your
apps using scenes

1610
01:22:49.726 --> 01:22:52.396 A:middle
and then connect those scenes
together very simply using the

1611
01:22:52.396 --> 01:22:54.236 A:middle
familiar Interface
Builder gestures.

1612
01:22:55.936 --> 01:22:59.016 A:middle
Interactive workflows, such
as popovers and sheets,

1613
01:22:59.316 --> 01:23:01.946 A:middle
can now be designed wholly in
the Interface Builder canvas,

1614
01:23:02.506 --> 01:23:04.666 A:middle
and containment relationships
such as tabs

1615
01:23:04.926 --> 01:23:08.966 A:middle
and splits-those use the new
OS X view controller APIs

1616
01:23:09.216 --> 01:23:12.296 A:middle
to make customization and
configuration really easy.

1617
01:23:13.106 --> 01:23:16.186 A:middle
So now you can use storyboards
to design all of your interfaces

1618
01:23:16.396 --> 01:23:19.996 A:middle
for both iOS and OS X.

1619
01:23:20.126 --> 01:23:22.216 A:middle
We have some other great
design tool additions for you.

1620
01:23:23.296 --> 01:23:26.626 A:middle
Asset catalogs now include
support for more asset types,

1621
01:23:26.856 --> 01:23:31.116 A:middle
including vector art like PDF
and also supports marking images

1622
01:23:31.116 --> 01:23:34.086 A:middle
as templates for the OS to
use as stencils at runtime.

1623
01:23:36.086 --> 01:23:38.436 A:middle
Interface Builder
documents are now searchable,

1624
01:23:38.736 --> 01:23:40.946 A:middle
both in the editor
and projectwide.

[ Applause ]

1626
01:23:47.176 --> 01:23:50.036 A:middle
Now, this searching
works on both strings

1627
01:23:50.166 --> 01:23:53.476 A:middle
and on property values like
connections and class names.

1628
01:23:53.816 --> 01:23:56.946 A:middle
So, investigation and making
mass change is really simple.

1629
01:23:58.776 --> 01:24:01.246 A:middle
And for iOS, we are
bringing custom fonts

1630
01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:02.776 A:middle
into the Interface
Builder canvas.

[ Applause ]

1632
01:24:09.446 --> 01:24:11.356 A:middle
So now these are rendered
live, and getting the layout

1633
01:24:11.356 --> 01:24:13.336 A:middle
and precision you
want is really easy.

1634
01:24:14.746 --> 01:24:17.166 A:middle
Now, in addition to
designing applications to work

1635
01:24:17.166 --> 01:24:19.966 A:middle
on multiple devices, you
want your apps to ship

1636
01:24:19.966 --> 01:24:23.026 A:middle
to as many people as
possible, and for this release,

1637
01:24:23.026 --> 01:24:25.756 A:middle
shipping to a worldwide
audience is even easier.

1638
01:24:26.606 --> 01:24:29.556 A:middle
For this release, we're
including support for XLIFF,

1639
01:24:29.696 --> 01:24:31.926 A:middle
the industry-standard
format for managing

1640
01:24:31.926 --> 01:24:33.856 A:middle
and exchanging localized data.

1641
01:24:35.186 --> 01:24:36.896 A:middle
Xcode now includes a workflow

1642
01:24:36.896 --> 01:24:39.716 A:middle
to automatically export
all the necessary content

1643
01:24:39.756 --> 01:24:40.556 A:middle
for localization.

1644
01:24:41.016 --> 01:24:43.376 A:middle
We'll run the necessary
processes on your source

1645
01:24:43.376 --> 01:24:46.206 A:middle
and interface documents,
and in just a few clicks,

1646
01:24:46.366 --> 01:24:48.496 A:middle
you have XLIFF to send
to your localizers,

1647
01:24:49.156 --> 01:24:51.936 A:middle
and integrating the changes
back from them is just as easy.

1648
01:24:53.056 --> 01:24:55.406 A:middle
Now, a benefit of this is
that you no longer need

1649
01:24:55.406 --> 01:24:58.176 A:middle
to use strings files for
your development regions.

1650
01:24:58.446 --> 01:25:01.586 A:middle
You can work solely in your
source and interface documents.

1652
01:25:08.486 --> 01:25:09.396 A:middle
And if that wasn't enough,

1653
01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:11.326 A:middle
we're going to bring
the localization content

1654
01:25:11.326 --> 01:25:14.066 A:middle
into the Interface Builder
preview editor as well.

1655
01:25:14.656 --> 01:25:17.266 A:middle
So, now in addition to
size classes and devices,

1656
01:25:17.526 --> 01:25:19.766 A:middle
you can pick from any of
the localization languages

1657
01:25:20.016 --> 01:25:22.066 A:middle
in your project and
view the results.

1658
01:25:22.066 --> 01:25:24.976 A:middle
If you've not yet
localized, fret not.

1659
01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.596 A:middle
You can use one of the
built-in pseudo localizations

1660
01:25:27.876 --> 01:25:29.376 A:middle
to see how your interface
will respond.

1661
01:25:30.346 --> 01:25:31.346 A:middle
So, now more than ever,

1662
01:25:31.346 --> 01:25:34.006 A:middle
it is easy to ship
applications for everybody.

design tools that work together

01:25:43.796 --> 01:25:46.706 A:middle
to make a really live and
interactive experience.

1666
01:25:46.996 --> 01:25:49.326 A:middle
But there's been one
piece that's been missing,

1667
01:25:50.016 --> 01:25:51.856 A:middle
and that's your custom controls.

1668
01:25:52.816 --> 01:25:55.306 A:middle
Starting today, that
is no longer,

1669
01:25:55.356 --> 01:25:57.836 A:middle

are now rendered live

1672
01:26:08.626 --> 01:26:10.416 A:middle
I was pretty sure you
were going to like that.

1673
01:26:10.496 --> 01:26:12.646 A:middle
So, let's go look at a
demo and see how it works.

1674
01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:23.236 A:middle
So, here we have a photo kind

1675
01:26:23.236 --> 01:26:25.716 A:middle
of scavenger hunt
application called Shutterbugs,

1676
01:26:26.126 --> 01:26:28.406 A:middle
and on the main screen
we have a custom control.

1677
01:26:28.976 --> 01:26:31.636 A:middle
It's showing the image from
one of the scavenger hunts.

1678
01:26:31.746 --> 01:26:34.586 A:middle
It's masked to a circle and
has some adornments around it.

1679
01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:37.856 A:middle
So, let's take a look in
Xcode 6 on how we will work

1680
01:26:38.146 --> 01:26:39.206 A:middle
with this custom control.

1681
01:26:41.376 --> 01:26:42.256 A:middle
Here's my project.

1682
01:26:42.356 --> 01:26:44.906 A:middle
On the left-hand side we have
our universal storyboard,

1683
01:26:45.326 --> 01:26:47.956 A:middle
and on the right-hand side I
have the code for my control.

1684
01:26:48.776 --> 01:26:51.356 A:middle
It's written in Swift, and
I'm also taking advantage

1685
01:26:51.356 --> 01:26:54.246 A:middle
of an iOS framework so
I can reuse this control

1686
01:26:54.246 --> 01:26:55.476 A:middle
across my applications.

1687
01:26:56.606 --> 01:26:58.636 A:middle
Now, in this case, we see our
custom control is currently

1688
01:26:58.636 --> 01:27:00.636 A:middle
rendering as just the big
white box here on the left.

1689
01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:03.966 A:middle
But surfacing it in the editor
as designable is really easy.

1690
01:27:04.626 --> 01:27:07.446 A:middle
All you need to do is add
in the IB designable keyword

1691
01:27:07.446 --> 01:27:10.376 A:middle
to my class, and the tools
will take care of the rest.

1692
01:27:11.006 --> 01:27:13.296 A:middle
Now, my custom control
is just rendered inside

1693
01:27:13.296 --> 01:27:14.586 A:middle
of the Interface Builder canvas.

[ Applause ]

1695
01:27:22.586 --> 01:27:24.156 A:middle
Now, you're looking at it
going, "That doesn't look

1696
01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:25.156 A:middle
like the picture did."

1697
01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:28.026 A:middle
There are some values, like
the photo and the name,

1698
01:27:28.026 --> 01:27:29.826 A:middle
that I typically
specify at runtime

1699
01:27:29.826 --> 01:27:31.326 A:middle
on an individual instance.

1700
01:27:32.026 --> 01:27:32.956 A:middle
We'll get to that in a moment.

1701
01:27:33.906 --> 01:27:36.726 A:middle
There are some other properties
of my control that I would

1702
01:27:36.726 --> 01:27:39.806 A:middle
like to allow people to
customize in Interface Builder,

1703
01:27:39.806 --> 01:27:42.546 A:middle
and the metaphor for that
is using the inspector.

1704
01:27:43.416 --> 01:27:45.066 A:middle
We've made that really
easy, too.

1705
01:27:45.566 --> 01:27:47.776 A:middle
So, for any property
that I want to expose,

1706
01:27:47.986 --> 01:27:51.586 A:middle
I can now add the IB inspectable
keyword, and I will do

1707
01:27:51.586 --> 01:27:53.366 A:middle
that on a handful
of the properties

1708

that I would like to expose.

1709
01:27:55.816 --> 01:27:58.286 A:middle
Once I do that and go
back to Interface Builder

1710
01:27:58.286 --> 01:27:59.516 A:middle
and select my control,

1711
01:27:59.516 --> 01:28:02.196 A:middle
at the top of the
inspector are now controls

So, let's adjust
this a little bit.

1715
01:28:13.216 --> 01:28:14.556 A:middle
I can make the border thicker.

1716
01:28:15.036 --> 01:28:18.026 A:middle
I can also pick a different
color font for the bezel.

1717

with the limited
capability that I wanted

1719
01:28:23.756 --> 01:28:25.156 A:middle
to expose to my developers.

1720
01:28:26.346 --> 01:28:28.956 A:middle
Now, let's go back to the
image content I was talking

1721
01:28:28.956 --> 01:28:29.566 A:middle
to you before.

1722
01:28:30.556 --> 01:28:34.186 A:middle
In some cases, you really want
the closest representation

1723
01:28:34.256 --> 01:28:36.796 A:middle
to your control as possible,
but you don't necessarily want

1724
01:28:36.796 --> 01:28:39.136 A:middle
to set values that are going to
work for everybody at runtime.

1725
01:28:40.086 --> 01:28:41.356 A:middle
We have a great mechanism
for you.

1726
01:28:41.526 --> 01:28:44.796 A:middle
There's new API on our
controls called Prepare

1727
01:28:44.856 --> 01:28:45.776 A:middle
for Interface Builder.

1728
01:28:46.256 --> 01:28:49.246 A:middle
And this is your ability to
provide all the necessary setup

1729
01:28:49.246 --> 01:28:51.786 A:middle
and configuration of your
control for how you want it

1730
01:28:51.786 --> 01:28:53.046 A:middle
to look while you're designing.

1731
01:28:53.666 --> 01:28:54.946 A:middle
Now, this is just for design.

1732
01:28:54.946 --> 01:28:57.616 A:middle
It won't ship this way, but
it gives you all the ability

1733
01:28:57.616 --> 01:28:59.536 A:middle
to surface your controls
in the way you want.

1734
01:29:02.586 --> 01:29:04.766 A:middle
Now, I've been working with
my, thank you [applause].

1735
01:29:08.116 --> 01:29:08.746 A:middle
There's still more.

1736
01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:12.266 A:middle
I've been actually
working with my application

1737
01:29:12.266 --> 01:29:15.436 A:middle
and localizing it, and I'd like
to see how my progress is doing.

1738
01:29:15.956 --> 01:29:17.566 A:middle
So for that, I will
switch the assistant

1739
01:29:17.906 --> 01:29:21.466 A:middle
over to the preview editor, and
here I will zoom in a little bit

1740
01:29:21.466 --> 01:29:22.526 A:middle
so we can see the results.

1741
01:29:23.516 --> 01:29:26.426 A:middle
Now, in the bottom right of the
preview editor is now a list

1742
01:29:26.426 --> 01:29:28.586 A:middle
of all the localizations
for my project.

1743
01:29:29.506 --> 01:29:30.606 A:middle
I can switch into any one

1744
01:29:30.606 --> 01:29:32.986 A:middle
of them-let's pick
Spanish-and we'll see

1745
01:29:32.986 --> 01:29:34.256 A:middle
that the interface updates.

1746
01:29:34.876 --> 01:29:36.526 A:middle
Now, it looks like
I'm doing pretty well.

1747
01:29:36.526 --> 01:29:38.876 A:middle
The controls at the bottom
updated, but we'll see

1748
01:29:38.876 --> 01:29:40.386 A:middle
that the name for
the control did not.

1749
01:29:40.906 --> 01:29:43.096 A:middle
That's an indication to me that
there's still more work for me

1750
01:29:43.156 --> 01:29:45.636 A:middle
to do, but I didn't have to
build and run to find that out.

1751
01:29:46.986 --> 01:29:49.466 A:middle
Let's select a, select
another language and make sure

1752
01:29:49.466 --> 01:29:50.866 A:middle
that everything's
looking correct.

1753
01:29:51.316 --> 01:29:54.036 A:middle
I've selected German
here, and now we'll notice

1754
01:29:54.036 --> 01:29:56.876 A:middle
that our interface is doing
somewhat of the right thing.

1755
01:29:57.236 --> 01:30:00.646 A:middle
I've been using autolayout
to lay out my controls,

1756
01:30:01.016 --> 01:30:02.996 A:middle
and it's keeping the
items from overlapping,

1757
01:30:03.276 --> 01:30:04.776 A:middle
but it's causing
one of the controls

1758
01:30:04.776 --> 01:30:06.796 A:middle
to get clipped unnecessarily.

1759
01:30:07.386 --> 01:30:09.046 A:middle
That's not quite
the UI I would like.

1760
01:30:09.926 --> 01:30:11.106 A:middle
So, that's not a problem.

1761
01:30:11.106 --> 01:30:12.376 A:middle
I can just go back over here

1762
01:30:12.376 --> 01:30:13.806 A:middle
into the Interface
Builder canvas

1763
01:30:14.066 --> 01:30:16.596 A:middle
and I can lower the priority
for one of those constraints.

1764
01:30:17.776 --> 01:30:20.166 A:middle
Doing that, we'll now see
that on the right-hand side,

1765
01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:21.176 A:middle
it lays out correctly.

1766
01:30:21.866 --> 01:30:24.346 A:middle
So, just like that, I've been
able to design my interface

1767
01:30:24.446 --> 01:30:26.966 A:middle
with my custom controls
and make sure it looks good

1768
01:30:26.966 --> 01:30:27.996 A:middle
in all languages.

1769
01:30:28.036 --> 01:30:31.976 A:middle
So, that's just a quick overview
of some of the great new tools

1770
01:30:32.056 --> 01:30:32.836 A:middle
for Interface Builder.

1771
01:30:33.516 --> 01:30:40.456 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1772
01:30:40.956 --> 01:30:42.636 A:middle
Now, in addition to
great design tools,

1773
01:30:42.636 --> 01:30:44.616 A:middle
we also have some great
new debugging tools

1774
01:30:44.616 --> 01:30:45.176 A:middle
for you this year.

1775
01:30:45.686 --> 01:30:47.436 A:middle
And it starts with
queue debugging.

1776
01:30:49.146 --> 01:30:51.666 A:middle
Oftentimes when working with
blocks, it can be difficult

1777
01:30:51.666 --> 01:30:53.666 A:middle
to keep track of where
your blocks are coming

1778
01:30:53.666 --> 01:30:55.166 A:middle
from or going to.

1779
01:30:56.296 --> 01:30:58.616 A:middle
Now, when you're debugging
your application and viewing

1780
01:30:58.616 --> 01:31:01.876 A:middle
by queues, you will have not
only the executing blocks

1781
01:31:02.106 --> 01:31:04.426 A:middle
but all of the pending
blocks available as well.

1782
01:31:05.306 --> 01:31:08.086 A:middle
And disclosing the pending
blocks will show you the

1783
01:31:08.086 --> 01:31:10.656 A:middle
enqueueing backtrace,
the backtrace

1784
01:31:10.656 --> 01:31:12.806 A:middle
on where this block was
added to this queue.

1785
01:31:13.516 --> 01:31:17.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1786
01:31:18.066 --> 01:31:19.406 A:middle
And the pending backtrace is,

1787
01:31:19.506 --> 01:31:21.706 A:middle
the backtrace is not
just for pending blocks.

1788
01:31:22.426 --> 01:31:26.316 A:middle
As you are executing and
evaluating your own blocks,

1789
01:31:26.416 --> 01:31:29.526 A:middle
the pending, the backtrace
is also included there too.

1790
01:31:29.826 --> 01:31:31.706 A:middle
So, now even more of the
history is available to you.

1791
01:31:32.726 --> 01:31:35.556 A:middle
Now, you may be wondering, as my
block moves from queue to queue

1792
01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:37.556 A:middle
to queue, do you
keep track of it?

1793
01:31:37.646 --> 01:31:38.866 A:middle
And the answer is yes.

1794
01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:40.626 A:middle
If you have a very
well-traveled block,

1795
01:31:41.076 --> 01:31:42.426 A:middle
all that information
will be available

1796
01:31:42.426 --> 01:31:43.576 A:middle
to you during debugging.

1797
01:31:44.516 --> 01:31:49.796 A:middle
[ Applause ]

1798
01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:51.756 A:middle
Next up are debug gauges.

1799
01:31:52.346 --> 01:31:55.156 A:middle
The debug gauges are a great
way to get an overview of kind

1800
01:31:55.156 --> 01:31:56.716 A:middle
of the performance
of your application,

1801
01:31:57.286 --> 01:31:59.646 A:middle
and for this release,
we're adding two new gauges

1802
01:31:59.996 --> 01:32:02.366 A:middle
in the form of network
I/O and disk I/O.

1803
01:32:03.386 --> 01:32:05.156 A:middle
These gauges give
you insight into some

1804
01:32:05.156 --> 01:32:07.436 A:middle
of the more intensive
operations for your application,

1805
01:32:07.826 --> 01:32:11.146 A:middle
showing read and write activity
and also giving you access

1806
01:32:11.196 --> 01:32:13.726 A:middle
to the list of active
resources in use.

1807
01:32:15.646 --> 01:32:18.526 A:middle
We've also updated the
debug gauges for graphics

1808
01:32:19.326 --> 01:32:20.456 A:middle
to work great with Metal.

1809
01:32:20.756 --> 01:32:23.466 A:middle
So, now you have all the same
debugging and profiling tools

1810
01:32:23.716 --> 01:32:25.106 A:middle
to tune your games in Metal.

1811
01:32:27.316 --> 01:32:29.836 A:middle
And we've also updated the
iCloud gauge and utilities

1812
01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:33.046 A:middle
to work great with CloudKit
and with iCloud documents.

1813
01:32:34.236 --> 01:32:36.536 A:middle
A new addition that's
really helpful is

1814
01:32:36.536 --> 01:32:40.346 A:middle
that this iOS simulator now
supports custom configurations.

1815
01:32:40.726 --> 01:32:43.356 A:middle
So, it's separate user
data and applications.

1816
01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:46.686 A:middle
This allows you to simulate
having multiple users

1817
01:32:46.686 --> 01:32:49.766 A:middle
on your machine so now testing
synchronization and sharing

1818
01:32:49.766 --> 01:32:51.306 A:middle
with iCloud is a breeze.

[ Applause ]

1820
01:32:59.176 --> 01:33:01.576 A:middle
Testing is a very
important and key area to us,

1821
01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.786 A:middle
and we are bringing you
two great new additions

1822
01:33:03.866 --> 01:33:04.936 A:middle
in our testing frameworks.

1823
01:33:05.406 --> 01:33:07.486 A:middle
The first is asynchronous
testing.

1824
01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:12.216 A:middle
XE test now includes a
flexible API to allow you

1825
01:33:12.216 --> 01:33:14.306 A:middle
to test your longer-running
systems.

1826
01:33:15.476 --> 01:33:18.766 A:middle
You can set up your tests
with predefined expectations,

1827
01:33:19.356 --> 01:33:22.586 A:middle
and those expectations can be
evaluated as your test runs.

1828
01:33:23.976 --> 01:33:24.936 A:middle
When you get to the
end of your test,

1829
01:33:25.306 --> 01:33:28.006 A:middle
if your expectations have
been met, your test passes.

1830
01:33:28.376 --> 01:33:29.916 A:middle
If not, your test fails.

1831
01:33:30.986 --> 01:33:32.976 A:middle
This simple approach
makes it really easy

1832
01:33:32.976 --> 01:33:35.726 A:middle
to test your asynchronous
systems right alongside

1833
01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:36.626 A:middle
with your other tests.

1834
01:33:38.406 --> 01:33:39.366 A:middle
But to go a step further,

1835
01:33:39.366 --> 01:33:41.846 A:middle
for this release we're moving
beyond correctness testing,

1836
01:33:42.046 --> 01:33:44.616 A:middle
and we're also adding
in performance testing.

1837
01:33:46.656 --> 01:33:49.816 A:middle
With performance testing, you
have a simple blocks-based API

1838
01:33:50.366 --> 01:33:52.946 A:middle
to identify areas of your
application that you would

1839
01:33:52.946 --> 01:33:54.416 A:middle
like evaluated for performance.

1840
01:33:55.546 --> 01:33:57.056 A:middle
Now, these blocks are
treated specially.

1841
01:33:57.496 --> 01:33:58.776 A:middle
When the test executes,

1842
01:33:58.976 --> 01:34:01.396 A:middle
we evaluate this
block multiple times

1843
01:34:01.466 --> 01:34:03.396 A:middle
so we can get a sampling
of your performance.

1844
01:34:03.956 --> 01:34:05.096 A:middle
And when the test ends,

1845
01:34:05.386 --> 01:34:07.746 A:middle
we surface the performance
results right inside

1846
01:34:07.746 --> 01:34:08.296 A:middle
of the editor.

1847
01:34:09.486 --> 01:34:12.496 A:middle
Now, as part of this, you
can also establish baselines

1848
01:34:12.866 --> 01:34:14.266 A:middle
as points of comparison
for your test,

1849
01:34:15.086 --> 01:34:17.236 A:middle
which means that as
you improve your tests,

1850
01:34:17.696 --> 01:34:19.306 A:middle
that'll be highlighted
in the editor as a win.

1851
01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.846 A:middle
On the off chance though that
your performance regresses,

1852
01:34:23.216 --> 01:34:24.786 A:middle
those will also be
highlighted in the editor

1853
01:34:24.786 --> 01:34:26.176 A:middle
as areas for investigation.

1854
01:34:27.466 --> 01:34:29.906 A:middle
Now, as part of this, you
also have access to all

1855
01:34:29.906 --> 01:34:31.836 A:middle
of the details running
for the test.

1856
01:34:31.836 --> 01:34:34.286 A:middle
So you have each of
the integration values,

1857
01:34:34.466 --> 01:34:36.306 A:middle
you also have access
to the baselines,

1858
01:34:36.546 --> 01:34:38.396 A:middle
and even the standard
deviations for your test.

1859
01:34:38.396 --> 01:34:40.846 A:middle
So you have complete
control of your tests.

1860
01:34:42.666 --> 01:34:45.016 A:middle
Now, as part of performance
testing, thank you.

[ Applause ]

1862
01:34:51.846 --> 01:34:53.416 A:middle
I do agree, performance
testing is very cool.

1863
01:34:54.396 --> 01:34:57.206 A:middle
Now, as part of this, a
part of performance testing,

1864
01:34:57.396 --> 01:34:59.366 A:middle
you also want to
analyze your tests,

1865
01:34:59.726 --> 01:35:02.276 A:middle
and we have by far the
coolest profiling tools

1866
01:35:02.276 --> 01:35:04.026 A:middle
on the planet, Instruments.

1867
01:35:04.786 --> 01:35:05.906 A:middle
So, for this release, we wanted

1868
01:35:05.906 --> 01:35:08.336 A:middle
to bring together
testing and profiling.

1869
01:35:08.976 --> 01:35:12.786 A:middle
So now, in the context menu
from any test or test bundle,

1870
01:35:13.056 --> 01:35:15.336 A:middle
you can profile them
right into Instruments.

1871
01:35:15.846 --> 01:35:18.546 A:middle
So, you can quickly look
down regressions or even look

1872
01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.356 A:middle
for opportunities
for improvement.

1873
01:35:21.536 --> 01:35:22.996 A:middle
Now, to sweeten the
deal even more,

1874
01:35:23.166 --> 01:35:25.676 A:middle
Instruments has a
brand-new design and layout

1875
01:35:25.676 --> 01:35:28.606 A:middle
that has been optimized for
a smoother user experience

1876
01:35:28.936 --> 01:35:31.576 A:middle
and to make investigating
issues even easier.

1877
01:35:32.836 --> 01:35:35.376 A:middle
In addition, in this release
we're also adding in support

1878
01:35:35.376 --> 01:35:37.466 A:middle
for performance counters
for iOS,

1879
01:35:37.826 --> 01:35:39.966 A:middle
which is a great new addition
to our profiling tools.

1880
01:35:43.346 --> 01:35:45.606 A:middle
Inherently, though, when you
are writing performance tests,

1881
01:35:45.996 --> 01:35:48.206 A:middle
you are identifying
areas of your application

1882
01:35:48.286 --> 01:35:51.086 A:middle
where performance is
sensitive or critical.

1883
01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:54.546 A:middle
Xcode and the compiler can
make use of this information

1884
01:35:54.806 --> 01:35:57.826 A:middle
with a new feature called
Profile Guided Optimization,

1885
01:35:58.256 --> 01:35:59.526 A:middle
or PGO for short.

1886
01:36:00.726 --> 01:36:03.026 A:middle
With PGO, your performance
tests are used

1887
01:36:03.026 --> 01:36:06.306 A:middle
to profile your application,
and that information is used

1888
01:36:06.306 --> 01:36:09.216 A:middle
in subsequent builds
to optimize your code

1889
01:36:09.216 --> 01:36:10.926 A:middle
for better runtime performance,

1890
01:36:11.556 --> 01:36:13.786 A:middle
so the result is
performance testing

1891
01:36:13.996 --> 01:36:16.406 A:middle
and performance improvement
all in one.

1892
01:36:17.716 --> 01:36:18.466 A:middle
And that's PGO.

1893

1894
01:36:25.096 --> 01:36:26.746 A:middle
Now, to take advantage of many

1895
01:36:26.746 --> 01:36:29.246 A:middle
of these new workflows
continuously during development,

1896
01:36:29.586 --> 01:36:31.666 A:middle
we've also updated
the Xcode bots

1897
01:36:31.976 --> 01:36:33.566 A:middle
with a new streamlined
interface,

1898
01:36:33.936 --> 01:36:36.846 A:middle
more configuration
options, and support for all

1899
01:36:36.846 --> 01:36:38.436 A:middle
of the new testing workflows.

1900
01:36:40.156 --> 01:36:43.446 A:middle
The new integration reports for
bots give you even more details

1901
01:36:43.446 --> 01:36:44.416 A:middle
about your integrations.

1902
01:36:45.006 --> 01:36:47.466 A:middle
We separated out new
from pre-existing issues,

1903
01:36:47.666 --> 01:36:50.846 A:middle
and we also tracked down
individual issues to committers

1904
01:36:51.206 --> 01:36:52.526 A:middle
and individual commits.

1905
01:36:53.186 --> 01:36:55.186 A:middle
So, you can quickly
find the guilty

1906
01:36:55.246 --> 01:36:58.096 A:middle
or the more responsible party
for any issue that comes up.

1907
01:36:59.686 --> 01:37:02.456 A:middle
We also have more
scheduling options and support

1908
01:37:02.456 --> 01:37:06.026 A:middle
for custom triggers, which you
can run your own scripts before

1909
01:37:06.026 --> 01:37:07.986 A:middle
or after any integration.

[ Applause ]

1911
01:37:14.396 --> 01:37:17.236 A:middle
And the new testing reports give
you access to all of the details

1912
01:37:17.236 --> 01:37:21.096 A:middle
about your tests, highlighting
regressions and improvements.

1913
01:37:21.766 --> 01:37:24.256 A:middle
You have access to all the same
data for your performance tests

1914
01:37:24.956 --> 01:37:26.646 A:middle
and including the
baseline workflows

1915
01:37:26.646 --> 01:37:27.956 A:middle
for managing those
on your server.

1916
01:37:29.166 --> 01:37:32.026 A:middle
These reports are also available
for the local testing workflows,

1917
01:37:32.066 --> 01:37:34.866 A:middle
so you can take advantage
of them on your desktop too.

1918
01:37:35.866 --> 01:37:38.896 A:middle
So, now even more great
reasons to use Xcode bots

1919
01:37:39.256 --> 01:37:40.296 A:middle
in your daily integrations.

1920
01:37:43.006 --> 01:37:45.276 A:middle
Now, we have one more
feature for you today.

1921
01:37:45.866 --> 01:37:48.526 A:middle
And this feature really
brings together the liveness

1922
01:37:48.526 --> 01:37:51.726 A:middle
of the design experience and
the debugging experience,

1923
01:37:52.326 --> 01:37:54.926 A:middle
and we're calling this
feature View Debugging.

1924
01:37:56.396 --> 01:38:00.066 A:middle
With View Debugging, you have
a live, interactive way to dive

1925
01:38:00.066 --> 01:38:02.126 A:middle
into the details of
the user interface

1926
01:38:02.406 --> 01:38:06.046 A:middle
of your running application, and
I'd like to give you a demo now

1927
01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:09.546 A:middle
of the now more visual way
to debug your applications.

1928
01:38:17.476 --> 01:38:19.496 A:middle
So, here we are,
back in our project.

1929
01:38:19.756 --> 01:38:21.576 A:middle
Let's just simplify our
view a little bit here.

1930
01:38:22.916 --> 01:38:25.006 A:middle
And remember, we were
running our application

1931
01:38:25.006 --> 01:38:26.056 A:middle
over here in the simulator.

1932
01:38:27.236 --> 01:38:29.386 A:middle
Now, if I wanted to
get more information

1933
01:38:29.386 --> 01:38:31.866 A:middle
about this interface, I
could pause and use some

1934
01:38:31.936 --> 01:38:34.006 A:middle
of the debugger introspection
tools,

1935
01:38:34.006 --> 01:38:35.646 A:middle
but there's an easier way now.

1936
01:38:36.046 --> 01:38:38.156 A:middle
In the debug bar,
there's a button here

1937
01:38:38.196 --> 01:38:40.906 A:middle
to capture my view hierarchy,
and I will click that.

1938
01:38:42.146 --> 01:38:44.016 A:middle
And you'll see that now
the main view is replaced

1939
01:38:44.016 --> 01:38:45.956 A:middle
with a snapshot of
my application.

1940
01:38:46.956 --> 01:38:48.856 A:middle
Now, this snapshot
is not a screenshot.

1941
01:38:49.136 --> 01:38:50.166 A:middle
It's actually an encapture

1942
01:38:50.166 --> 01:38:52.786 A:middle
of the entire view
hierarchy of my interface.

1943
01:38:54.386 --> 01:38:57.066 A:middle
Let's change perspective a
little bit to see if that helps.

1944
01:38:59.516 --> 01:39:06.896 A:middle
